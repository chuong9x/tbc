<h3>New Material</h3>

<p>A quick post from my vacation in sunny and windy

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
How can I create a new material in Revit?
I have searched in vain for something like Document.Create.NewMaterial.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Searching in the Revit API help file for NewMaterial does indeed yield no results at all.
However, searching for the two separate words "new material" returns a number of hits. 
In my case, the third is the Duplicate method, and the fourth the AddOther method.
As far as I can see, those two represent the two different possible approaches to create new materials:</p>

<p>One is the use of the Material.Duplicate method, which is demonstrated by the Revit SDK sample Materials.</p>

<p>The other is to use one of the material adding methods on the Materials class, which provides access to the set of materials in a Revit project.
It provides the following methods for adding new materials:

<ul>
<li>AddConcrete to add a concrete material. 
<li>AddGeneric to add a generic material. 
<li>AddOther to add an other material. 
<li>AddSteel to add a steel material. 
<li>AddWood to add a wood material. 
</ul>

<p>Once a material has been duplicated or added, you can modify its properties to suit your needs.</p>
