<h3>Practical Notes on Impractical Things</h3>

<p>I just learned that the two introductory images presented in the article on the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/revit-form-creation-api.html">
Revit form creation API</a>

came from Zach Kron, whose blog

<a href="http://buildz.blogspot.com">
Buildz</a>

presents lots of interesting 'practical notes on making impractical things' in Revit.</p>

<p>Here is a pointer to a completely different kind of practical note on another blog:</p>

<h4>Disable Auto Setback in Framing Template</h4>

<p>Several developers have been struggling with some of the hard-coded Revit behaviour.
Miroslav Schonauer just pointed out that he and Sarah Capes found a solution for one specific problem on an Autodesk Consulting project, which is documented in this article on 

<a href="http://bimandbeam.typepad.com/bim_beam/2009/07/framing-templatehow-to-disable-auto-setback.html">
how to disable auto setback in a framing template</a>.

<p>And to round off today's 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potpourri">
potpourri</a>,

here is another issue around the topic of form creation:</p>

<h4>NewSweptBlend Failure</h4>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
I am trying to use the NewSweptBlend method, but it throws an exception saying “The attempted operation is not permitted in this type of family.” What can I do to solve this?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
This indicates that swept blends are not supported in the category type of the family where you are attempting to create it.</p>

<p>If it is a 2D family type, you would get this exception, and maybe also on a few other types as well.</p>

<p>In your specific case, the code uses a Conceptual Mass template and tries to create a SweptBlend in it. 
If you want to work in a Conceptual Mass template, you must use the NewSweptBlendForm method instead. 
If you want to use NewSweptBlend, then use a non-mass template.
Note the difference between a generic model and conceptual mass.</p>
