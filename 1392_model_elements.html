All Model Text, StringSearch 2016 and New Jobs #revitapi #bim #aec #3dwebcoder #adsk

I migrated another one of my samples to Revit 2016: StringSearch. That was prompted by a question on extracting all visible text from the Revit model that I will take a closer look at below

<h3>Retrieving All Model Elements</h3>
<p>Let's revisit the ever-recurring topic of <a href="#3">retrieving all model elements</a>, and also look at a
well-documented <a href="#2">workflow for retrofitting historical buildings</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Workflow for Retrofitting Historical Buildings</h4>
<p>If you are interested in the detailed description of a workflow for retrofitting historical buildings,
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/reality-computing/renovating-milan-s-teatro-lirico-opera-house/ba-p/5976733">renovation of the Milano Teatro Lirico opera house</a> may
provide a worthwhile read.</p>
<p>The almost 10,000 square meter, 1500-seat theatre renovation weighs in at over 16 million euros in cost.</p>
<p>A technical team using a Leica laser scanner captured the detailed theatre geometry, producing 550 scans with 6.5 billion points.</p>
<p>The point cloud data was processed to generate an accurate 3D virtual model of the theatre in its current state using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://recap.autodesk.com">ReCap</a> for point cloud management</li>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-family/overview">Revit</a> for the creation of the 3D existing conditions model and the development/assessment of design alternatives</li>
<li><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview">3ds Max</a> to generate photorealistic project visualizations</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole process is extensively documented in the Autodesk University class <a href="http://au.autodesk.com/au-online/classes-on-demand/class-catalog/2015/recap/rc9940">RC9940 handout document</a> and
the 6-minute video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hSZbkB00q8">Teatro Lirico</a>:</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>Retrieving All Model Elements</h4>
<p>'All model elements' means something different to every application, of course, so you will always need to adapt the details to your own needs.</p>
<p>This topic was prompted by several recent cases and the Revit API discussion forum thread
on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/all-model-elements-in-project/m-p/5972035">all model elements in project</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I get the model elements?
This old code from The Building Coder discussion
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/selecting-model-elements.html">selecting model elements</a> does not work anymore.
Thank you in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, indeed, the code that you are pointing to is pretty old.</p>
<p>However, as pointed out in that post, the code is part of the ADN Revit API training material, in the Revit API Introduction Lab 2-2.</p>
<p>That material is continuously maintained, and an up-to-date version is available from two separate GitHub repositories:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial">Autodesk Revit Training material</a>, the official training material pointed to from the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">Revit Developer Centre</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra">ADN Revit API Training Labs including Xtra</a>, an enhanced version maintained by my humble self</li>
</ul>
<p>You could grab the current version from there, if you like, e.g., directly
from <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/blob/master/XtraCs/Labs2.cs#L506-L686">XtraCs/Labs2.cs</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, luckily for you, a number of different other approaches to solve this very issue have been presented by The Building Coder in the topic group on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.9">filtering for all elements</a>.</p>
<p>I just updated the links under 'Selecting Model Elements or Visible 3D Elements' for you, listing the following possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/selecting-model-elements.html">Valid category and non-empty geometry</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/select-model-elements-2.html">Ditto, and eliminate certain categories</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/visible-elements.html">Valid category and neither category nor element is hidden</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/selecting-model-elements.html">Based on the Category.HasMaterialQuantities property</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/model-elements-revisited.html">Based on the elements visible in a default 3D view</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/08/determining-absolutely-all-visible-elements.html">Using a custom exporter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
