<h3>Create a Real Revit Ribbon Tab</h3>

<p>We made it to Paris on Friday after all, arriving a ten in the morning instead of the Thursday evening as planned.
Still, we were able to successfully present the DevDays conference, so that was good.
That was also the last day of my working year, at least officially.
I spent the evening in Paris and had a nice train ride through the snow back to Switzerland on Saturday.

launch Revit external commands</a> as usual.

<p>I am hoping to find time in the next few days to present some more of the goodies I am sitting on before I head off into a real break.
