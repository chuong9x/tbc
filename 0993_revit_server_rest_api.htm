<!-- 08650337 [Automate Extraction of Revit data from file on Revit Server] -->

<h3>The Revit Server REST API</h3>

<p>Let's take a look at the material available for programmatic access to the Revit Server.</p>

<p>This came up in a developer query on automatically extracting data from a Revit model housed there.</p>

<p>The automatic extraction of data requires batch mode opening of a Revit model and launching of a command, for which there is no direct Revit API support.</p>

<p>However, this can be easily worked around using normal batch files to start Revit with a given project file, an add-in implementing OnStartup and OnDocumentOpened event handlers, and possibly the Idling event. The unsupported journaling mechanism may also come in handy, but should and mostly can easily be avoided.</p>

<p>Simply put:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a batch file that calls Revit.exe and provides a project file command line argument.</li>

<li>Revit will start up and load that file.</li>

<li>If you have installed an external application, its OnStartup method will be called and can perform certain actions, e.g. subscribe to the document opened event.</li>

<li>In the document opened event handler, you can start manipulating the document in the way you need.</li>

<li>If that event is too restrictive, you can subscribe to the Idling event in the event handler.</li>

<li>The Idling event handler is free to do almost anything you can imagine and should be enough to fulfil your needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>With that in place, we can proceed with the Revit Server question:</p>



<p><strong>Question:</strong> Yes, we have built a console application for executing Revit.exe to open the Revit file and extract the data using the add-in we developed.
This is working perfectly fine.

<p>Our next goal is to automate the extraction process from the Revit Server standpoint.</p>

<p>In out current scenario, we have Revit Server and Revit Client running in multiple locations with 50-75 users, all updating their Revit files to the server.</p>

<p>Question 1: How can I determine which models have been modified or updated in Revit Server.
Can the Revit Server API provide this information?
We obviously only want to extract the data from modified models.

<p>Question 2: Where do I locate the RVT project files in the Revit Server?
When working in Revit I see a folder structure like this:

<center>
<img src="img/miniscule_rvt.png" alt="Miniscule RVT file"/>
</center>

<p>Please note the miniscule file size of the highlighted Model.rvt, which is just 1 KB. </p>

<p>If I try open this file in Revit MEP, it fails and throws an exception.</p>


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Congratulations on completing your command line tool for driving Revit and automatically extracting the required data.</p>

<p>Regarding the Revit Server API, I presented some basic information and a sample application making use of the

Revit Server REST API</a> back

in 2011, followed by a discussion on how to use it to

copy a model from a Revit Server</a>.

The Revit Server API has not changed since then.</p>

<p>You might want to start off by looking at the user interface tools for

managing Revit Server</a> to get an idea of how the system works.

<p>My colleague Adam Nagy presented the Revit Server REST API at DevCamp using this slide deck,

<a href="zip/Revit Server API.pdf">
Revit Server API.pdf</a>,

which focuses mainly on the REST API aspect in general and includes several useful pointers to further information at the end.</p>

<p>All further documentation and samples are provided in the Revit Server SDK, which is part of and lives in its own sub-folder of the standard Revit SDK.</p>

<p>You can also find a number of further examples on the Internet by

googling for 'revit server rest api'</a>, e.g.:</p>
