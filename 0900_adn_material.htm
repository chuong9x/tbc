<!-- <h3>Eliminating MEP and Structural Compiler Warnings and Deprecated Calls</h3> -->

<h3>ADN Revit API Training Material Update and Vacation</h3>

<p>After cleaning up the usage of

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/eliminating-compiler-warnings-and-deprecated-calls.html">
deprecated Revit API calls</a> in

The Building Coder samples, I decided to clean up the ADN training material as well.

<p>My original plan was to remove all warnings about deprecated API usage, only I quickly discovered there were none to remove  :-) </p>

<p>In the MEP sample application

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html">
AdnRme</a>,

I just updated the year listed in the copyright message to 2013 and produced AdnRme version 2013.0.2.0.

<p>I then did the same for the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/04/xtra-adn-revit-2013-api-training-labs.html">
ADN Revit API Training labs</a> and the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/the-revit-2013-structure-api.html">
Revit Structure API samples</a>.

<p>Here is the result of that,

<h4>Vacation Time</h4>

<p>This is the last post before my vacation.
Well, actually, this is already during my vacation.</p>

<p>I am hopping on a train in a minute and departing for Italy with unknown itinerary and goals.
A possible candidate is Lecce, in the far south.</p>

<p>I'll be back in two and a half week's time, and keep you posted, maybe.</p>

<p>Bye!</p>
