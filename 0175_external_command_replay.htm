pointed out a few important items related to the preceding post on 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/journal-file-replay.html">
replaying a journal file</a>:</p>

<span style="color:darkblue">

<p>One topic that you did not cover &ndash; using the journal file with Revit external commands.</p>

<p>Here are some things that I've noticed in the past:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your external command has dialog boxes, your application will freeze if Revit is being driven by a journal.
<li>The alternative to this is to use the JournalData StringStringMap in the ExternalCommandData which is passed to you.
<ul>
<li>You can read values from the StringStringMap and use them instead of your dialog boxes.
<li>You can write the values at the end of your command &ndash; based on what the user selected &ndash; so that your existing commands can be played back.
</ul>
<li>When last I looked at it (2009?) there were problems playing back your command if it included calls to select elements using PickOne or WindowSelect.
</ul>

<p>Thank you Matt for these valuable hints!</p>
