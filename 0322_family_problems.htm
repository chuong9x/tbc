<!-- Family problems... by Greg Wesner -->

<h3>Family Problems Missing Components</h3>

<p>The title of this question from my colleague Greg Wesner of Autodesk is so nice, I just had to add it to the blog, even though we have actually already provided the explanation a long time ago.

<p><strong>Question: Family problems...</strong> ... no, not that kind – Revit Family problems :-)

<p>This seems so simple, yet I'm way too tired to try to figure this out. 
I'm porting some code that I didn't write from Revit 2009 to 2010. 
I'm getting an error because of this line:

<pre class="code">
<span class="blue">foreach</span>( <span class="teal">Element</span> e <span class="blue">in</span> m_family.Components )
{
&nbsp; <span class="green">// do something to element e</span>
}
</pre>

<p>I looked it up in the Revit Platform API Changes document and found the following:

<p style="color:darkblue">New document methods &ndash; Document.LoadFamily and Document.EditFamily &ndash; are introduced ... as a result, the properties of Family which access the contents have been removed (Family.SolidForms, Family.VoidForms, Family.Components, Family.LoadedSymbols, Family.Others).

<p>I've been looking around for a while now, and I don't see any obvious way to get to the equivalent of 'Components' in the 2010 Family API. 

<p>The Revit 2009 SDK included the FamilyExplorer sample, but it seems it was dropped for 2010. Pity. 
I searched your blog and haven't found anything obvious for this one. 

<p>Any ideas? Even just pointing me to a sample would be great.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, that property was removed. 
In Revit 2010, you can just open the family document instead and iterate over its elements in the normal fashion. 
I actually did provide an explanation and explicit replacement code in the post describing
