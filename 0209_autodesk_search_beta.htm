<h3>Autodesk Search Beta</h3>

<p>We recently mentioned two new online search possibilities, the availability of 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html">
online help for the Revit product</a>

and Rod Howarth's customised 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-api-help.html">
global Revit API search</a>.

Here is another note in the same vein:</p>

<a href="http://searchbeta.autodesk.com">
Autodesk Search Beta</a>

is now available and provides a number of new capabilities including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type-ahead.
<li>“Did you mean...”
<li>Filter by publish date, site source, etc.
<li>Expanded search scope covering discussion forums, blogs, online product documentation, community sites and the Autodesk channel on YouTube.
</ul>

<p>Please check it out and provide feedback to help validate and fine tune the technology, and possibly justify using it to replace the current search functionality.</p>

<p>I tested the search with the keywords "newsweep revit" and it returned exactly two hits, i.e. not too few nor too many, both of which were perfectly relevant, i.e. no junk.</p>
