<h3>Cloning a Solid, AngelHack, 3D Web Fest and Dubai</h3>

<p>The Revit 2016 offers a whole host of exciting new functionality that I am dying to try out, e.g.:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#5.04">Custom exporter supports 2D output</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#4.10">Improved ReferenceIntersector linked model support</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#4.16">DirectShape supports curves, points and references</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#5.03">Cool new Geometry API functionality</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html">much, much more...</a></p>

<p>Too little time!</p>

<p>At least I can mention one useful aspect of the new geometry API that came in handy for an issue that came up yesterday.</p>

<p>I am in Dubai right now, preparing for the AngelHack Hackathon.</p>

<p>Here are the topics for today:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#2">3D Web Festival in San Francisco</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">AngelHack in Dubai</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">AngelHack in Athens</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Autodesk University proposals</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Cloning a solid</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>3D Web Festival in San Francisco</h4>

<p>Hey, there is this really cool event coming up in San Francisco on May 13<sup>th</sup>,
the <a href="http://www.3dwebfest.com">3D Web Festival</a>,
sponsored by Autodesk, Goo Technologies and Leap Motion:</p>

<h4>AngelHack and I&hearts;3D in Dubai</h4>

<p>As said, I am in Dubai right now, for the first time in my life.</p>

<p>Here are my

<p>Tonight we hold the
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/I-love-3D-Dubai/events/221497781">AngelHack Dubai Pre-Hackathon Meetup and Workshop</a>
to get all interested
<a href="http://angelhack.com/hackathon/dubai-2015">AngelHack Dubai Hackathon</a> participants
up to speed on the View and Data API in preparation for two hot and frantic days of hacking over the weekend &ndash; which is Friday and Saturday here, of course.</p>

<h4>AngelHack and I&hearts;3D in Athens</h4>

<p>We also just held the inaugural
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/I-love-3D-Athens">I love 3D &ndash; Athens</a> meetup,
on April 24<sup>th</sup>, at
<a href="http://thecube.gr">The Cube</a>,
Greece's biggest coworking space.</p>

<p>Cyrille Fauvel and Peter Schlipf presented the View and Data API, Fusion360, AutoCAD I/O and Recap360 to a group 30 enthusiastic local developers:</p>

<p>They loved it.</p>

<p>I will be going there too soon, for the
<a href="http://angelhack.com/hackathon/athens-2015">Angelhack in Athens</a>, on June 5-7.</p>

<p>Again, we have scheduled an

<a href="http://www.meetup.com/I-love-3D-Athens/events/221674308">AngelHack workshop</a> meetup
session on Friday evening to get us all well prepared and up to speed for the subsequent hackathon.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to meeting you there!</p>

<h4>Autodesk University proposals</h4>

<p>The
<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals">Autodesk University Call for Proposals</a> has opened.</p>

<p>I am already busy preparing mine &nbsp; :-)</p>

<h4>Cloning a solid</h4>

<p>Now, finally, back to the Revit API, with a question on cloning solids, very well addressed by one of the Revit 2016 API enhancements:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> To clone solids, we have been using the following workaround in the past:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">static</span> <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="teal">Solid</span> Clone( <span class="blue">this</span> <span class="teal">Solid</span> solid )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( solid == <span class="blue">null</span> )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> <span class="blue">null</span>;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> <span class="teal">BooleanOperationsUtils</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .ExecuteBooleanOperation( solid, solid,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">BooleanOperationsType</span>.Union );
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>This function allows us to clone solids to later use them to create or modify DirectShape elements.
It works very well in the majority of the cases; however, the ExecuteBooleanOperation function throws an exception on some specific DirectShape elements, saying:</p>

<ul><li>Exception: "Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids. Error: Autodesk.Revit.Exceptions.InvalidOperationException: Failed to perform the Boolean operation for the two solids"</li></ul>

<p>I would be very grateful if you can give me some directions how to fix this issue.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Have you noticed the following new functionality provided by the
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html">Revit 2016 API</a>
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#5.03">Geometry API additions</a>?</p>

<div class="darkblue">
<h4>Solid &ndash; copy</h4>

<p>The new method:</p>

<ul><li>SolidUtils.Clone()</li></ul>

<p>creates a new Solid that is a copy of the input Solid.</p>
</div>

<p>That looks as if it should solve your problem for you more elegantly and efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong>

Thanks for the quick answer.</p>

<p>The SolidUtils.Clone method does indeed solve the issue for Revit 2016. It works perfectly. Thanks!</p>

<p>However, what can I do to fix it in Revit 2015?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I am very glad to hear that the issue is solved in Revit 2016 by the SolidUtils.Clone enhancement.</p>

<p>For Revit 2015 and previous versions, a better workaround, rather than unioning the original solid with itself, might be to union the shape with a small cube (1" x 1" would work for most shapes) located in the interior of the shape.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you!</p>

<p>I can confirm that the workaround solves the issue I was having with the Revit 2015 API.</p>
