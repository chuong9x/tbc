<h3>Creating a Non-rectangular Slab</h3>

<p>Here is a question raised and answered by my colleagues Katsuaki Takamizawa and Phil Xia on creating and editing a slab.

Some related topics that we already discussed are related to the analysis of the geometry of existing slabs, e.g. the

slab boundary</a>

and its

side faces</a>,

explorations of the

geometry of other elements</a>,

the

eave cut property</a> of roof slabs,

and how to

edit a floor profile</a>.

Now let's look at this generic slab issue:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
In the user interface, we can use the shape editing tools to modify slab surfaces and to create non-rectangular slabs. 
Is it possible to create slabs like these through the API as well?</p>

<p>Also, can we define slope angles on these non-rectangular slabs?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
You can modify the slab surface with the slab editor, accessible through the SlabShapeEditor property on the Floor class.
The SDK sample SlabShapeEditing shows how to use it.

<p>There is no way to modify the slope of an existing slab, but it can be specified when a new slab is created with NewSlab method:

<pre>
public Floor NewSlab(
  CurveArray profile,
  Level level,
  Line slopedArrow,
  double slope,
  bool isStructural
)
</pre>

The parameters are:

<ul>
<li>profile: an array of planar lines and arcs that represent the horizontal profile of the slab.
<li>level: the level on which the slab is to be placed.
<li>slopedArrow: a line to control the sloped angle of the slab. It should be in the same face as the profile.
<li>slope: defines the slope. 
<li>isStructural: specifies whether the slab is structural.
</ul>

<p>Many thanks to Phil and Katsu-san for this overview!</p>
