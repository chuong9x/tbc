<h4>Collaborative Translation of Homestyler</h4>

<p>I discussed the possibility demonstrated by Kean Walmsley of using UI Automation and hooking up machine translation to

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/translate-revit-tooltips.html">
translate the Revit tooltips</a>,

which was later turned into the full-fledged 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/transtips-adn-plugin-of-the-month.html">
TransTips ADN Plugin of the Month</a> for

all four products AutoCAD, Inventor, Revit and 3ds Max.

<p>At the same time we are seeing improvements in the help systems by integrating support for collaboration and community building, e.g. for the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/revit-api-developer-guide-on-autodesk-wikihelp.html">
WikiHelp-based Revit API Developer Guide</a>.

<p>Now the first steps are being made to integrate collaborative support to localise a complete product: Homestyler into Russian.

<p>If you are interested and know at least a bit of Russian, please log in to

join the 150+ translator community to help support this effort.
