<h3>Solid Material</h3>

<p>Here is a simple question with a simple answer on materials and solids:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a way to retrieve the material of the solid geometry object of a Revit Element, like the door leaf of a door element?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, I am not aware of any way that a material can be assigned to a solid. 
The only representation of the solid in the graphical user interface is through its faces, and they can have materials assigned to them. 
As far as I know, the solid itself has no such property. 
The only way that I am aware of to

of a solid is through the path Solid > Faces > FaceArray > Item > Face > MaterialElement.
