<h3>Families Guide</h3>

<p>A long time ago, in the far distant past, before the advent of the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-revit-family-api.html">
Family API</a>, 

Revit API developers and family content creators were two entirely separate camps with their own secret arts and magic charms.
Since then, we have been given programmatic access to the family creation functionality, and the synergy in the union of these two camps is growing.

<p>This makes it all the more important for any developer to have an in-depth understanding of the family creation process.
One effective way to build this kind of understanding is to work through the 

<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=13080413&linkID=9243097">
Revit Families Guide</a>.

The latest version provided is for 

<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&id=13376394">
Revit 2010</a>.

It includes readme files, documentation, and datasets for hands-on exercises, all of which are provided in fourteen languages and both metric and imperial versions.
Strongly recommended for anyone diving into Revit customisation or programming in any depth.

<p>Here is also a short (8 minute) live training tutorial:</p>
