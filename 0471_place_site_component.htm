<h3>Place Detail Instance</h3>

<p>After several discussions on placing family instances, such as the use of

detail instances in 2D</a>, 

here is a another question in a similar vein on placing trees and site components from Jeremiah Farmer of

<a href="http://www.landfx.com">
Land F/X</a>.

<p>And by the way, I am hoping (ever so slightly) that this discussion and the tools presented below may help Kristoffer with his

furniture insertion problem</a> as well.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am trying to automate the placement of trees into the Revit model.
I can't seem to find the appropriate NewFamilyInstance overload to call, or call it correctly.
And <strong>nowhere</strong> can I locate an example of placing a Site Component through the API.  
This is killing me!
Please, please help with this, or if you can direct me somewhere.
Know that this will greatly speed Disney's adoption of Revit, as well as many of our other clients.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> What have you tried so far?
 
Have you seen the discussion on

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/place-detail-instance.html">
placing a detail instance</a>?
 
<p>Two snippets of code that may be useful for testing that cropped up since I published that:

<ol>
<li><a href="#1">PlaceInstancesOnViews</a>: This method tests placing a specific family instance in all views, to ensure that a detail instance can indeed be placed in a detail view using the NewFamilyInstance overload taking the arguments XYZ, targetFamily, view.

<li><a href="#2">TestAllOverloads</a>: This method calls all possible overloads of NewFamilyInstance in order to find one that works.
</ol>

<p>Here is the code for these two:

<p>I hope that this will be of use in you further research.
 
<p>Please let me know how you fare and what you come up with!
 
<p><strong>Response:</strong> I had not seen that example, but that is very similar to what I finally got working last night.

<p>It seems Site Components need to be attached to the Topo Surface, so I end up calling NewFamilyInstance with XYZ, FamilySymbol, TopoSurface, StructuralType.

<p>It turns out the Z coordinate can be zero, by specifying TopoSurface it will be anchored correctly. 

<p>I also had to come up with two helper functions, one to locate the TopoSurface, and one to locate the FamilySymbol reference (as LoadFamilySymbol only returns a Boolean, not a reference to the FamilySymbol!  
How crazy is that?).

<p>So I think I'm on my way.  
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you getting back to me!

<p>I'd be happy to share!
Here is 

<a href="zip/placeplant.vb">
placeplant.vb</a> containing

the basic outline of what I have so far, representing the first portion of our Revit add-on.
I should inform you that this is to be part of a commercial application, Land F/X.  

<p>The hurdles I have cleared so far were finding the appropriate overload of NewFamilyInstance to use for Site Components, as well as the creation of the two helper functions (which I'm positive can be simplified or optimized in some fashion, but at least they work!).
You can see I have also figured out how to set various parameters of the Family Symbol, as well as the Instance, and have marked up my findings on later creating custom Parameters for these values.

<!-- 
<p>Today I will be placing this routine within a loop, to have it process multiple Trees.
I'll send over that version no later than early next week, and it should also include ample comments. 
-->

<p>Very many thanks to Jeremiah for his enthusiasm and this solution and sample code for placing site components!
