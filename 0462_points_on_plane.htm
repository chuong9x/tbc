<h3>Plane Normal and Points on Plane</h3>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have an origin point and a normal vector and wish to determine three points to create a reference plane. How can I calculate the third point using normal and origin?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This is very elementary geometry. 
If you have an origin point and a normal vector, you can easily calculate three points in a plane. 
Conversely, if you have three points in a plane, it is easy to calculate the normal vector. 

<p>Let 'x' denote the vector 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">
cross product</a>. 

<p>Given an origin point P and a normal vector N:

<ul>
<li>Select an arbitrary vector V that is not collinear with N, e.g. the X or Y axis. 
<li>Set U = N x V to obtain a vector that is perpendicular to N. 
<li>Set V = N x U to obtain another vector perpendicular to both N and V. 
<li>Set Q = P + U and R = P + V to obtain three points P, Q and R in the plane.
</ul>

<p>Given three points P, Q and R in the plane:

<ul>
<li>Set V = Q - P and W = R - P to obtain two perpendicular vectors in the plane. 
<li>Set N = V x W to obtain the plane normal.
</ul>

<p>I published a number of posts demonstrating this. 
The most useful ones for you might be the ones describing the GetCurveNormal method:
