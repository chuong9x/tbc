<h3>Transaction Responsibility</h3>

<p>The last post on

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/transactions.html">
transactions</a>

explained the need to open a transaction of our own before trying to modify a document during an event.
That is actually not all.
We also need to remember that starting a transaction is not permitted at all times, and also that starting a new transaction or ending one may fail.
This leaves us with a certain amount of responsibility.
Therefore, we should add some error handling to ensure that failures are handled gracefully.
The sample should be amended like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="blue">void</span> application_OnDocumentNewed( <span class="teal">Document</span> doc )
{
&nbsp; <span class="green">// we cannot modify the document </span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">// unless a transaction is started</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( doc.BeginTransaction() )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// once a new transaction is started</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// we are responsible for ending or </span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// aborting it, so we have to put </span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// everything in a try-catch block</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">try</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CreateUserDefinedParameters( doc );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// we are responsible for ending </span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// the transaction we started</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doc.EndTransaction();
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">catch</span>( <span class="teal">Exception</span> )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// if we cannot finish what we wanted</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// we should probably abort the whole thing</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; doc.AbortTransaction();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">throw</span>; <span class="green">// re-throw the exception</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
}
</pre>

<p>Thank you to Arnost Lobel and Harry Mattison for providing this feedback!</p>

<p>I have arrived in Perugia by now ... rather slow progress, but getting there.</p>
