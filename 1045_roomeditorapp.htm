<h3>RoomEditorApp for Revit 2014 on GitHub</h3>

<p>I discussed my Revit add-in for my cloud-based, real-time, round-trip, 2D Revit model editing application on any mobile device in depth last spring, with the last update on its

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/05/my-cloud-based-2d-editor-implementation-status.html">
implementation status</a> published

back in May.</p>

<p>Even at that time, since I was mainly concentrating on the exciting cloud aspects of the application, I had added quite a bit of functionality to the Revit add-in that I never got around to documenting, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>External application</li>
<li>Automatic immediate BIM update from cloud database</li>
<li>Subscription toggle button</li>
</ul>

<p>The various aspects that I did already discuss are listed in The Building Coder

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/desktop">
Desktop</a> category.

<p>By popular demand, I also provided an emergency stop-gap update of the source code for the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/sydney-revit-api-training-and-vacation.html#9">
latest Revit 2013 version</a> during the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/sydney-revit-api-training-and-vacation.html">
Sydney Revit API training</a> in July.

<p>I now really have to get going with the preparation of my AU presentations, and one of the unavoidable steps is migrating this application to Revit 2014, which is what I discuss here and now.</p>

<h4>Clone and Compile DreamSeat</h4>

<p>One of the prerequisites for interacting with the cloud database is obviously uploading and querying of its data.</p>

<p>I use CouchDB as the cloud database and the

<a href="https://github.com/vdaron/DreamSeat">
DreamSeat .NET library</a> to

access it from my C# Revit add-in.</p>

<p>To create the library for my add-in to reference, I cloned the DreamSeat GitHub repository to my local system:</p>

<pre>
  git clone https://github.com/vdaron/DreamSeat
</pre>

<p>Since it was last built using a newer version of Visual Studio, I had to edit the two first lines in the DreamSeat.sln solution file to be able to use Visual Studio 2010 instead.
I simply changed them to read:</p>

<pre>
Microsoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 11.00
# Visual Studio 2010
</pre>

<p>No other changes required, the library compiled, and I can add a reference to it to my Revit add-in project.</p>

<h4>RoomEditorApp Migration from Revit 2013 to Revit 2014</h4>

<p>I created a new Visual Studio solution for a new Revit add-in named RoomEditorApp and copied the code from my old Revit 2013 GetLoops add-in into it.</p>

<p>After the flat migration, the compilation completes and just reports

<a href="zip/room_editor_app_migr_2014_1.txt">
16 obsolete API usage warnings</a>,

which seems pretty good.</p>

<p>I posted the flat migrated version to the

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp">
GitHub RoomEditorApp repository</a> and

created an initial version

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/releases/tag/2013.0.0.9">
2013.0.0.9</a> to

provide a starting point from which to track my changes.</p>

<p>I easily fixed all the warnings, as described in numerous previous discussions, and published version

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/releases/tag/2014.0.0.10">
2014.0.0.10</a> compiling

with zero errors and warnings.</p>

<p>Oops, I also need to change my namespace from GetLoops to RoomEditorApp.
This became obvious as soon as I attempted to load the external application in Revit, since it complained about the missing RoomEditorApp.App specified in the add-in manifest, which was still named GetLoops.App.
The namespace is correctly specified in

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/releases/tag/2014.0.0.11">
version 2014.0.0.11</a>.</p>

<p>Oops again; it next complained on loading into Revit about lacking the embedded icon resources.
Luckily, my external application includes assertions that ensure that the required resources are actually found, so I noticed what the problem was.
Here is finally

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp/releases/tag/2014.0.0.12">
version 2014.0.0.12</a> with

icons added and displaying the user interface successfully in Revit 2014:</p>

<h4>Installing CouchDB</h4>

<p>For testing purposes, I prefer a local installation of my database in addition to the cloud-based one.</p>

<p>That obviously also requires a local installation of the CouchDB database system itself as well.</p>

<p>To create that, simply go to

<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">
Apache CouchDB</a>,

click on 'download', install, and restart the computer.</p>

<p>I install it as a service and later go into the computer management and set the service to be started manually instead of automatically, so it is only available when actually needed.</p>

<h4>Replicate the Database</h4>

<p>Since I already have my cloud-based application up and running on the

<a href="http://www.iriscouch.com">
Iris Couch</a> cloud

CouchDB server from my last experiments, I can simply replicate that.</p>

<p>The database base URL is

<a href="http://jt.iriscouch.com/roomedit">
jt.iriscouch.com/roomedit</a>,

whereas the entry point to access and test it is its main application file index.html at

<a href="http://jt.iriscouch.com/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html">
jt.iriscouch.com/roomedit/_design/roomedit/index.html</a>.

<p>I can replicate it using the CouchDB Futon interface on my local machine installation, replicating to a new local database named 'roomedit' from the cloud-based database instance:</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>I am up and running now in Windows 7 and Revit 2014, as opposed to my rather obsolete previous installation based on Windows XP and Revit 2013.</p>

<p>I still have a lot of undocumented features that I would love to discuss here in the Revit side of things.</p>

<p>As said, I need to prepare my AU presentation and handout on this topic.</p>

<p>Whereas the Tech Summit presentation that I worked on in the spring focused heavily on the cloud aspects, the AU presentation will be significantly longer and cover both the cloud database and the Revit add-in features.</p>

<p>Therefore, I can document the missing bits and pieces in the coming weeks as I get my AU material ready, with the deadline for handing in the material on November 15 looming on the horizon.</p>
