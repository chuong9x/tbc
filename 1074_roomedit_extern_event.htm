<h3>Replacing an Idling Event Handler by an External Event</h3>

<p>I arrived back in Europe safe and sound from America.</p>

<p>Healthy, as well, in spite of air conditioning and the freezing temperatures in some of the Autodesk University conference rooms.</p>

<p>Thank God, I went well prepared with long-sleeved woollen underwear and thick heavy sweaters to face the arctic challenges of the desert town.</p>

<p>As I hinted at when describing my

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/12/au-day-3-recap-cloud-based-round-trip-model-editing.html">
last day at AU</a>,

I realised that I can significantly improve the implementation of the RoomEditorApp subscription to real-time database changes by replacing the Idling event I was using previously by an external event:</p>

</ul>

<p>I implemented that during the trip home, actually, in a very few hours.</p>

<p>I spent significantly more time over the weekend putting together the following detailed documentation, so I really hope you enjoy and appreciate it.</p>

<p>That obviously means that I had less time to prepare for the series of European DevDays conferences starting Monday morning in Paris.</p>

<p>I'll have to wing it somehow, I guess.</p>

<p>Here is the sequence of stops I will attend:</p>

<ul>
<li>2013-12-09 &ndash; DevDay, Paris, France</li>
<li>2013-12-10 &ndash; DevDay, Milan, Italy</li>
<li>2013-12-11 &ndash; DevDay, Farnborough, United Kingdom</li>
<li>2013-12-12 &ndash; DevDay, Munich, Germany</li>
<li>2013-12-13 &ndash; DevLab, Munich, Germany</li>
<li>2013-12-16 &ndash; DevDay, Gothenburg, Sweden</li>
</ul>

<h4>Idling versus an External Event</h4>

<p>In fact, maybe it is best to avoid using the Idling event completely when you require a continuous check for external changes to react to, since it only gives you the choice between either calling SetRaiseWithoutDelay or not.</p>

<p>If you call it, Revit will hog the processor and bring down the system performance.</p>

<p>If you do not, you will only be called once every time Revit enters the Idling state.</p>

<p>A new Idling state can be triggered in Revit by just moving the cursor across its graphics screen.
That effect is described and used by Joe Ye to implement a programmatic

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/07/tricks-to-force-trigger-idling-event.html">
trick to trigger the Idling event</a>,

as briefly mentioned as a

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/curve-length-idling-units-and-revitpythonshell.html#3">
potential SetRaiseWithoutDelay workaround</a>.</p>

<p>Use of an external event instead of Idling gives an add-in much more control over the timing behaviour.</p>

<p>You can run your external check in a separate thread, make full use of the various .NET or Windows threading options to make regular checks for pending updates at specified intervals and totally relinquish control of the CPU in between, avoiding the performance hit of using SetRaiseWithoutDelay and yet activating the check as often as desired.</p>

<p>I rewrote the RoomEditorApp check for database updates using an external event instead of Idling as described below.</p>

<p>After completing that and getting it to work perfectly, just the way I want, I noticed one unexpected little drawback:</p>

<p>When I raise the external event with nothing else happening in the system, Revit does not react immediately.
It just sits there doing nothing, although I can see from my debugging messages that the external event I registered and raised is pending.</p>

<p>If I move the cursor over the Revit screen, the pending external event is processed almost immediately.</p>

<p>Sometimes Revit decides to process it without moving the cursor, but hardly ever right away.</p>

<p>This prompted me to remember the trick described above, and the next step I plan is to update the RoomEditorApp to trigger immediate external event processing by simulating a mouse move event in the Revit graphics screen.</p>

<p>Let's look at the individual steps in detail.</p>



<a name="3"></a>

<h4>Implementing the RoomEditorApp External Event</h4>

<p>An external event is created by the Revit API by calling the static ExternalEvent.Create method and passing in the custom event handler to it, represented by an instance of a class implementing the IExternalEventHandler interface.</p>

<p>The previous RoomEditorApp implementation working with the Idling event handler already defined a DbUpdater class providing a UpdateBim method that was called by the handler when it determined the presence of pending database updates.</p>

<p>That represents an obvious candidate for implementing the new external event handler interface, so I added IExternalEventHandler as a new DbUpdater base class:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">class</span> <span class="teal">DbUpdater</span> : <span class="teal">IExternalEventHandler</span>
</pre>

<p>The Idling version of the DbUpdater class kept track of the current Revit document in a dedicated member variable _doc.</p>

<p>The new version is more or less document independent &ndash; I hope!
It stores the Revit UI application instead and retrieves the currently active document from that when needed.
This will certainly work fine when you are only working with one single document, as is the case in my testing scenario:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Current Revit project document.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">//Document _doc = null;</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Revit UI application.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="teal">UIApplication</span> _uiapp = <span class="blue">null</span>;
</pre>

<p>Except for that modification, the <b>existing</b> DbUpdater class implementation remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The new <b>additional</b> methods handle two aspects:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#4">Implementing the IExternalEventHandler interface</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Checking for pending database changes in a separate thread</a></li>
</ul>



<a name="4"></a>

<h4>Implementing the IExternalEventHandler Interface</h4>

<p>The IExternalEventHandler interface is pretty minimal.</p>

<p>All it requires is the implementation of two methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <b>Execute</b> method invoked by Revit via the external event as a reaction to a call to its Raise method.</li>
<li>The <b>GetName</b> method returning a descriptive name.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what they look like in my case:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Execute method invoked by Revit via the </span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> external event as a reaction to a call </span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> to its Raise method.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">void</span> Execute( <span class="teal">UIApplication</span> a )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// As far as I can tell, the external event </span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// should work fine even when switching between</span>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//Document doc = a.ActiveUIDocument.Document;</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//Debug.Assert( doc.Title.Equals( _doc.Title ),</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//&nbsp; &quot;oops ... different documents ... test this&quot; );</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; UpdateBim();
&nbsp; }
&nbsp;

&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> <span class="blue">string</span>.Format(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="maroon">&quot;{0} DbUpdater&quot;</span>, <span class="teal">App</span>.Caption );
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<h4>External event creation and disposal</h4>

<p>The creation and disposal of the external event is more trivial still.</p>

<p>Just like the Idling event subscription, I decided to handle it in the main add-in external application implementation.</p>

<p>Instead of keeping track of the Idling event handler, it now holds on to an instance of the external event it creates:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Store the Idling event handler when subscribed.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">//static EventHandler&lt;IdlingEventArgs&gt; _handler = null;</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Store the external event.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="blue">static</span> <span class="teal">ExternalEvent</span> _event = <span class="blue">null</span>;
</pre>

<p>The actual creation and disposal in achieved by the ToggleSubscription that was already in place for the Idling event subscription:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Toggle on and off subscription to </span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> automatic cloud updates.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">static</span> <span class="teal">ExternalEvent</span> ToggleSubscription(
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// EventHandler&lt;IdlingEventArgs&gt; handler</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">IExternalEventHandler</span> handler )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( Subscribed )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">Debug</span>.Print( <span class="maroon">&quot;Unsubscribing...&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//_uiapp.Idling -= _handler; </span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//_handler = null; </span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _event.Dispose();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _event = <span class="blue">null</span>;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _buttons[3].ItemText = _subscribe;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _timer.Stop();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _timer.Report( <span class="maroon">&quot;Subscription timing&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _timer = <span class="blue">null</span>;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">Debug</span>.Print( <span class="maroon">&quot;Unsubscribed.&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">else</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">Debug</span>.Print( <span class="maroon">&quot;Subscribing...&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//_uiapp.Idling += handler;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//_handler = handler;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _event = <span class="teal">ExternalEvent</span>.Create( handler );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _buttons[3].ItemText = _unsubscribe;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _timer = <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">JtTimer</span>( <span class="maroon">&quot;Subscription&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">Debug</span>.Print( <span class="maroon">&quot;Subscribed.&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> _event;
&nbsp; }
</pre>



<a name="6"></a>

<h4>Creating and Managing the External Event</h4>

<p>OK, OK, so all the above is obvious and trivial, you say?</p>

<p>So where is the challenge, what is the interesting part, where is the use and big advantage of all this?</p>

<p>Well, that is the part we address now:</p>

<p>By escaping from the Idling event invoked by Revit internally as it sees fit, with the minimal timing control provided by the SetRaiseWithoutDelay method, we gain several advantages:</p>

<ul>
<li>We have full control over the timing of our calls to the external event Raise method.</li>
<li>We have full access to the methods provided by the Windows and .NET APIs, e.g. Sleep, timers, threads etc.</li>
<li>We can run the check for external changes that need to be reacted on in a separate thread!</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of calling the main external application's ToggleSubscription method directly and passing in the Idling event handler, the external command to subscribe to database changes now calls an intermediate ToggleSubscription method implemented by the DbUpdater class that forwards it to App.ToggleSubscription and simultaneously launches the separate thread.</p>

<p>The entire read-only CmdSubscribe implementation thus now looks like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="teal">Result</span> Execute(
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">ExternalCommandData</span> commandData,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ref</span> <span class="blue">string</span> message,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">ElementSet</span> elements )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( !<span class="teal">App</span>.Subscribed
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &amp;&amp; -1 == <span class="teal">DbUpdater</span>.LastSequence )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">DbUpdater</span>.SetLastSequence();
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">//App.ToggleSubscription( OnIdling );</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">DbUpdater</span>.ToggleSubscription(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; commandData.Application );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> <span class="teal">Result</span>.Succeeded;
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>The DbUpdater.ToggleSubscription method thus achieves the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Toggle subscription to automatic database updates.</li>
<li>Forward the call to the external application that creates the external event.</li>
<li>Store the external event.</li>
<li>Launch a separate thread checking for database updates.</li>
<li>On Detecting pending changes, invoke the external event Raise method.</li>
</ul>

<p>The code to achieve this is actually more succinct than the verbal description:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Toggle subscription to automatic database </span>

&nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">static</span> <span class="blue">void</span> ToggleSubscription(
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">UIApplication</span> uiapp )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; _event = <span class="teal">App</span>.ToggleSubscription(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">DbUpdater</span>( uiapp ) );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( <span class="blue">null</span> == _event )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _thread.Abort();
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _thread = <span class="blue">null</span>;
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">else</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// Start a new thread to regularly check the</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// database status and raise the external event</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// when updates are pending.</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _thread = <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">Thread</span>(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CheckForPendingDatabaseChanges );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _thread.Start();
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<h4>Checking for Pending Database Changes in a Separate Thread</h4>

<p>So, we started a new thread to check for database changes.</p>

<p>That was awfully simple, wasn't it?</p>

<p>When creating it, we pass in a method to execute.</p>

<p>It is not complicated either.</p>

<p>In fact, it is completely trivial as well, and just slightly bloated by debug and log messages for monitoring its behaviour.</p>

<p>It currently looks like this, including a couple of bookkeeping and tweaking variables that might come in handy for measuring and optimising performance:</p>

<pre class="code">

<p>Most significantly, of course, the _timeout variable controls the number of milliseconds to wait between each repetition of the database check for pending updates.</p>

<h4>Waiting for Revit to React</h4>

<p>As I mentioned in the beginning of this discussion, when the external event has been raised, Revit does not actually call the external event Execute method until a cursor movement or some other system event wakes it up.</p>

<p>Here is an extract from a sample log file demonstrating this.
I generated it by making changes to the cloud database via the browser, observing that the external event is raised immediately, waiting for a while and then moving the mouse to trigger Revit to forward the notification by calling the external event (copy and paste somewhere or view source to see truncated lines in full):</p>

<p>As you can see, there is sometimes a significant delay between the moments when the database update pending event is raised and when it is actually forwarded by Revit to the external event Execute method, at which point the code switches back to check for new changes again.</p>

<p>In most cases, it was possible to trigger the forwarding simply by moving the cursor on the screen.</p>

<p>A similar effect is described and used by Joe Ye to implement the programmatic

trick to trigger the Idling event</a>,

as briefly mentioned as a

potential SetRaiseWithoutDelay workaround</a>.</p>

<p>That is obviously the next step I will explore to complete my understanding, perfect this application and make optimal use of the external event mechanism.</p>

<p>For now, though, I think this is enough for today.</p>

<h4>Triggering Immediate External Event Processing</h4>

<a href="">

<pre class="code">

A: In my previous reply, I shared an article that can make revit idling event triggered continiously by changing the mouse position left and right. So the ildling event can be triggered ceaselessly.

The other method is in the end of the idling event handling calling SetRaiseWithoutDelay method to trigger the event handler without break. This is also annoy when the end-user is back to his table and star to work using Revit, they cannot stop that lenghy process at once.  Well, I think we have a trick here. In the Idling event handler before you call the SetRaiseWithoutDelay() method, we can check if the mouse position is different from its previous position( say greater than 2 pixel), then you stop calling the SetRaiseWithoutDelay() method.

In your Idling event hander, you can also calculate how long that the end-user didn't move the mouse, say 10 seconds, then you can start to do the lengthy job.

<h4>Addendum &ndash; Revit Requires Focus</h4>

<p>Guy Robinson has some comments on this and says:</p>

<p>Here are a few more things to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>External events won't fire if Revit doesn't have focus.</li>
<li>Because they're managed by the OS if you try raising external events continuously the period grows increasingly large as it tries to ensure the external events aren't hogging the system.
At least that's my explanation of the result.</li>
</ul>

<p>Admittedly it's been a while since I was experimenting with this.
But I think the behaviour will be the same.
I found I had to keep using Idling because external events couldn't replicate the high frequency firing possible with Idling.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Guy for this valuable input!</p>

<p>It matches my findings.
I still hope to find a way to stick with external events, though, to avoid the Idling event hogging the system.</p>

<p>I also noticed that Revit needs focus to actually forward the external event Raise invocation to call its Execute method.
I am still hoping to find an easy clean way to trigger that programmatically from outside...</p>
