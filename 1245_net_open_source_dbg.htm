Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition (Free download) now available, and it supports DLL debugging!

<h3>.NET Open Source and Visual Studio Community</h3>

<p>Steve Mycynek of the Revit Development team pointed out an important update on .NET and Visual Studio:</p>

<p>As you may know, one frustration faced by Revit API developers is the lack of debugging support in the free Express versions of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>They do not support debugging DLLs against an EXE host or attaching to a process, which is exactly what we require to debug a Revit add-in loaded into Revit.exe (except by

used, e.g., for the

space adjacency for heat load calculation add-in</a>).</p>

<p>This meant that if you wanted official support to debug a Revit add-in, you had to buy an expensive Visual Studio License &ndash; until now!</p>

<p>Last week, Microsoft presented a large set of free and open source announcements, including Visual Studio Community Edition, which is free and supports many more advanced features.</p>

<p>I just tried it out, and, as you can see, it also supports Revit add-in debugging:</p>
