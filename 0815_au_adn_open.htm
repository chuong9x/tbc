<h3>AU Registration and ADN Open</h3>

<p>Preparations for Autodesk University 2012 on November 27-29 at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas are moving along as usual.

<a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/portal/newreg.ww">Registration</a> is 

now open, and, following 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/08/registration-open-for-au-2012.html">
Kean's suit</a>,

I just registered as well.

I already mentioned the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/update-api-assembly-references-and-wizards.html#3">
classes I will be presenting</a>. 

More details on these have emerged, since the time plan has been settled and the 

<a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/search.ww">
AU class catalogue</a> is

now available:

</ul>

<p>Before the beginning of the conference proper, I will obviously be attending the 

<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=adn_conference_devlab&amp;und=1786">ADN conference at AU</a>

(<a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6302">6302</a>) on 

Monday with its 

<a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6303">AEC breakout session</a> in

the afternoon, and happily the late afternoon round table timing on Tuesday will also allow me to spend almost all that day at the 

<a href="https://www.autodeskuniversity2012.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=6306">DevLab</a>, 

which is always one of the very most interesting chances to interact directly with developers and their issues.

<h4>Autodesk Developer Network Open</h4>

<p>Something else that just opened up wide, besides the AU registration, is the Autodesk Developer Network ADN.

<p>In the past, this was reserved for members only, to a certain extent.

<p>As you probably noticed, we recently opened up significantly by launching numerous ADN DevBlogs publishing programming and customisation solutions.

<p>Certain members-only areas remain, such as free access to Autodesk software, preview releases, and direct support.

<p>We are making a large effort to simplify access to the basic knowledgebase content, though, and to support discussion forums.

<p>One goal is that a simple Google search should bring up all available information on Autodesk API questions, and to strongly encourage peer-to-peer support in discussion groups.

<p>Stephen Preston published an announcement 

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2012/08/introducing-adn-open.html">
introducing ADN Open</a>

describing the whole scenario in full, and 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/08/the-adn-program-opens-its-doors.html">
Kean Walmsley's description</a> adds 

additional background.
