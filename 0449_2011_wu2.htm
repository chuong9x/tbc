<h3>Revit 2011 Web Update 2</h3>

<p>I am currently attending an Autodesk-specific non-technical training in a pretty posh old English manor house, 

<a href="http://www.elvethamhotel.co.uk">
The Elvetham</a>.

Apparently, Queen Elizabeth I planted an oak tree here which is still standing, 
and King Henry VIII met one of his wives here, back in the sixteenth century.

<p>In more recent news, a colleague just pointed out the

<a href="http://revitoped.blogspot.com">
Revit OpEd</a> blog

featuring a concise and clear overview of the newly released 

<a href="http://revitoped.blogspot.com/2010/09/revit-web-update-2-posted-subscription.html">

its relationship to other upcoming updates.

<p>The first update in June, Revit 2011

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/revit-2011-web-update-1.html">
Web Update 1 (WU1)</a> is 

included in Web Update 2 (WU2), so it is not necessary to install WU1 first.

<p>Here is the list of the WU2 API enhancements which extend the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/revit-2011-web-update-1.html">
WU1 ones</a> and are also applicable across all three flavours for Architecture, MEP and Structure, copied out of the enhancements list documents Enhancements_List_RAC_2011_UR2.pdf and the same for RME and RST:

<ul>
<li>Setting formula for Manufacturer/Type Comments as string no longer throws an exception.
<li>Improves consistency between User Interface and API when using Family Type count.
<li>Improves the consistency of maintaining the preview image when Save/SaveAs.
<li>Improves the consistency of creating the detail curve when the views detail sketch plane is not located where expected within the database.
<li>Improves detail curve creation when the view does not have an implicit sketch plane.
</ul>

<p>The RME enhancement list mentions the following two additional MEP specific API enhancements:

<ul>
<li>Cabletray Connector Angle property no longer throws an exception when rotating a
cabletray.
<li>MEP API: The following Electrical Parameter Types have been exposed to DB.ParameterType:
<ul>
<li>CABLETRAY_SIZE
