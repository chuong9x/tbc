09926155 [Error at requesting thumbnail using REST (RLA)]

-->

<h3>Revit Server Thumbnail Requires Redistributable</h3>

<p>Here is a quick answer to a simple Revit Server question to close for this week:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> My application retrieves thumbnails of models stored on Revit Server 2014 via REST calls using the following code:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  WebRequest request = WebRequest.Create(
    "http://&lt;ServerName&gt;"
    + "/RevitServerAdminRESTService2014"
    + "/AdminRESTService.svc/&lt;folder&gt;"
    + "|demorevitserver_ab.rvt/thumbnail"
    + "?width=200&height=200" );

  request.Method = "GET";

  request.Headers.Add( "User-Name",
    "d5783faa-3548-4e6e-be9a-aeca05c59352" );

  request.Headers.Add( "User-Machine-Name",
    "MyComputerXyz" );

  request.Headers.Add( "Operation-GUID",
    Guid.NewGuid().ToString() );

  // Next line fails
  // The remote server returned an error:
  // (500) Internal Server Error.

  WebResponse response = request.GetResponse();
</pre>

<p>I checked the log file AdminRESTService.log on the server and do not see what the problem could be there.</p>

<p>How can I solve this, please?</p>


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In this case, the log file does not reveal the exact cause of the failure.</p>

<p>However, we analysed a similar case in the past.
The problem there turned out to be that the 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable (x64)' was not installed on the server.</p>

<p>Please check whether this is also the cause in your case.</p>

<p>The installer has meanwhile been updated to include the required component.</p>


<p><strong>Response:</strong> I finally found a solution that works for me: installing both the 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable x64’ and the 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable x64’ solves the problem.</p>

<p>So not only the 2010 version as you suggested, but both the 2010 and 2012 versions.</p>
