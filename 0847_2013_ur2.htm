Revit Architecture 2013 Update Release 2</a>.

<p>Phew. 
That was rather hard.

<p>A much easier way to reach the exact download I am after is to enter the appropriate string in Google.
That takes me directly to the download page with no need to manually traverse any convoluted paths.

<p>Here is a list of the Google search strings I entered and the resulting URLs:

<ul>
