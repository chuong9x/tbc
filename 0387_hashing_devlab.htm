<h3>Hashing and DevLabs</h3>

<p>We successfully finished DevCamp yesterday.
It ended after lunch, so we had time to drive out to our new hotel and the Autodesk office in Waltham.

<p>The AEC workgroup that I belong meets every week in a phone conference, since we are spread out all across the world.
It was great to be able to sit down and talk face to face for a change, even though we sadly were not complete since not all were able to travel over here.

<p>I spent the evening with Michael Priestman, lead developer of the Navisworks core team, who very kindly introduced me to the joys and rituals of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers">
hashing</a>.

Michael is a long-time member of the 

<a href="http://www.clearbase.co.uk/hashsite/index.htm">
Sheffield hashers</a>,

and he had found out when and where the 

<a href="http://bostonhash.com">
Boston hashers</a> were 

holding their weekly meeting.

<p>After completing my first hash I am no longer Virgin Jeremy, but promoted to Just Jeremy.
I liked it very much and will definitely look up possibilities to go hashing back home in Switzerland.
An evening very well spent.
Running cross-country like that, rain does not matter anymore in the least.

<p>Now I am looking forward to seeing what surprises today will bring.

17 developers have registered for the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/devcamp-devlabs-and-updated-api-training-schedule.html#devlabs">
DevLab</a> taking 

place today and tomorrow here in Waltham.

We will sit down together and discuss any issues that they may be having with their products and programming and our APIs.

I am sure that will be very interesting and hope that there will be some resulting titbits that can be shared here later during the day.
