<p><strong>Question:</strong> When I select an element in the Revit model, the ribbon tab is always switched.
Is there any way to keep 'Add-Ins' tab focused at all times?

It will then remain available at all times, regardless of how the other ribbon tabs are switched back and forth.

<li>As I already mentioned discussing the

ribbon tab context toggle</a>, 

you can also select Big R &gt; Options &gt; User Interface and uncheck 'Display the contextual tab on Selection':
</ul>
