<h3>Embedding an Interactive View and Data IFC Model</h3>

<p>Here is an interactive 3D sample embedding of an IFC file uploaded to A360 to answer a question in this morning's DevDays conference here in Munich:</p>

        mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
</center>

<p>Click to navigate, rotate, pan and zoom as you like.</p>

<p>I was prompted to upload and test the IFC file format translation by Adam Nagy, sitting together in the back row, after taking neat pictures of

<p>I simply grabbed an old sample IFC file (6.5 MB) I had sitting on the disk, uploaded it to A360 and embedded it here into this post.</p>

<p>It only took a handful of minutes to complete the whole process.</p>

<p>Here are some other samples of developers experimenting with similar things in the past few days:</p>
