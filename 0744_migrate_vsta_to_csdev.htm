<h3>Migrating VSTA Macros to SharpDevelop</h3>

<p>As you probably noticed, we held a very successful and exciting Revit API training course and DevLab

recently</a>

Melbourne</a>.

<p>More face-to-face hands-on trainings are planned, as you can see from the ADN

entering "Revit API" as the course name.

<h4>Revit API Hands-On Training in Munich</h4>

<p>The next scheduled class that I will be conducting is taking place in Munich, Germany, on April 25-26

(<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?id=6703509&siteID=123112&cname=Revit%20API,%20Munich,%20Apr%2025%202012,%20201213">register</a>).

<p>If you are interested in participating in a class, you will benefit enormously by

preparing appropriately</a>. 

The material we provide for that can also be used very well to learn the basics of the Revit API for yourself all on your own.

<p>Meanwhile, here are some notes on the changes required to migrate our existing

(<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/my-first-revit-plug-in-in-vb.html">VB</a>)

code from Revit 2012 to 2013, reported by Saikat Bhattacharya:

<h4>Migrating VS 2010 Express Code</h4>

<p>The only change was to update the following line of code using the obsolete Document.Element property:

<pre>
  Element elem = pickedRef.Element;
</pre>

<p>This needs to be changed to call the Document.GetElement method:

<pre>
  Element elem = doc.GetElement(pickedRef);
</pre>

<h4>Migrating VSTA to SharpDevelop</h4> 

<p>There were a couple of steps in this migration:

<p><strong>1.</strong> Open the RVT files with embedded macros in SharpDevelop.

<p><strong>2.</strong> Change the .NET framework version to 4.0:

<center>
<img src="img/vsta_to_csdev_1.png" alt="Set .NET Framework version" width="400"/>
</center>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Remove existing references to the Revit API assembly DLLs and reference the Revit 2013 ones instead.

<p><strong>4.</strong> Delete the following line, since VSTA no longer exists in the Revit namespace:

<center>
<img src="img/vsta_to_csdev_2.png" alt="Remove VSTA add-in id" width="400"/>
</center>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Make the API changes in the code, essentially just the one line mentioned above for the VS Express change:

<center>
<img src="img/vsta_to_csdev_3.png" alt="Update Element property to GetElement method" width="400"/>
</center>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Update the description of the macro in the MacroManager dialogue.

<p>I repeated the same set of steps for all the existing VSTA samples for C# and VB.NET for them to work with SharpDevelop.

<p>Many thanks to Saikat for this report!
