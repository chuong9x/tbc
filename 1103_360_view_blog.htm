Hi Stephen,

Manu is ready to start blogging.

Could you add the link to the AEC DevBlog?  Maybe to the C/M one, too?

Would you like to advertise about it?

If it helps, I wrote like this:

<p>Manu and

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/mikako-harada.html">Mikako Harada</a>,

ADN AEC technical lead, worked together closely on the BIM 360 Glue API.
Manu is the behind the scenes 'brain' for ADN support in this area and helped a lot preparing the last two Developer Days presentations about BIM 360.

<p>As Mikako already

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2013/10/bim-360-glue-api-pilot-and-updated-samples.html">pointed out</a>,

the Glue API is still in a pilot stage and the number of people who can actually use it is currently very limited.
We are actively discussing ways to expand the audience and I hope you will find
