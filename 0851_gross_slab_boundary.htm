<h3>Gross Slab Boundary and the Temporary Transaction Trick</h3>

<p>Last week I provided an

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/slab-boundary-revisited.html">
updated version</a>

of the  

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/slab-boundary.html">
CmdSlabBoundary</a>

external command to determine a floor slab boundary.

<p>Here is a follow-up to that issue:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> The solution provided to 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/10/slab-boundary-revisited.html">
retrieve the slab boundary</a> works 

fine for me if no openings are cut out.

<p>I have a situation where my slabs are cut by openings, however, and I need to retrieve the original uncut gross slab boundary.

<p>Here is an example with two slabs A and B and an opening cutting out part of both of them:</p>

<p>The solution provided retrieves the cut out net slab boundary:</p>

<p>How can I obtain the following original gross uncut slab boundary?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> One way to obtain the unmodified geometry of the slab is to use the temporary transaction trick to temporarily eliminate all openings and other elements affecting its shape.

<p>This technique was used to 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/material-quantity-extraction.html">
determine gross material quantities</a> of 

floors, walls and roofs in the material quantities sample from Scott Conover's Autodesk University 2009 class on 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/analyse-building-geometry.html">
analysing building geometry</a>,

which was later add to the Revit SDK as the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/material-quantity-extraction.html">
MaterialQuantities</a> sample. 

<p>It shows how the transaction handling for the temporary operation can be simply and cleanly encapsulated. 

<p>It analyses the material quantities of walls, floors, and roofs, and outputs the result to Excel by implementing the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Collect all roof elements
<li>Iterate through each material found in each roof element
<li>Find the net volume and area of the material
<li>Store the material quantities
<li>Write the results to the output file
<li>Find the gross material quantities
<ol type="a">
<li>Start a new transaction
<li>Delete the elements that cut the host (doors, windows, openings)
<li>Find the volume and area for each material
<li>Store the material quantities
<li>Write the results to the output file
<li>Rollback the transaction
</ol>
<li>Repeat the above steps for walls and floors
<li>Open the output file in Microsoft Excel
</ol>

<p>To determine the boundary lines of the floor slab with all opening removed, you could proceed in the same fashion as described in step 6 for obtaining the gross material quantities.

<p>Temporarily delete then openings in a separate transaction, retrieve the original slab geometry, and abort the transaction to restore the original state. 

<p>This technique is easy to implement.
We reused this method for many different purposes a number of times, e.g.

<p><strong>Addendum:</strong> Arno&scaron;t L&ouml;bel pointed out that 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/11/temporary-transaction-trick-touchup.html">
this will not always work</a>.

Some modifications require the transaction to be committed before they take full effect.
The 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/11/temporary-transaction-trick-touchup.html">
workaround</a> for 

that is to enclose it within a transaction group and roll back the group at the end.

Unfortunately, they also restrict the participation to AutoCAD apps, so Revit add-ins are not permissible.
