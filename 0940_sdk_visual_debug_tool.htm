<h3>Revit 2014 SDK and Visual Debugging Tools</h3>

<p>Two hot topics for today, especially the first:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Updated Revit 2014 SDK</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Visual debugging tools</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Updated Revit 2014 SDK</h4>

<p>An updated Revit 2014 SDK is live on the ADN Open

<p>This version includes RevitLookup and the AddInManager!</p>

<h4>Visual Debugging Tools</h4>

<p>Rudolf Honke of

<a href="http://www.acadgraph.de">
Mensch und Maschine acadGraph GmbH</a> discovered

a glitch in the definition of the room solids in one of the standard sample RVT project files.</p>

<p><strong>Rudi says:</strong> When testing VRML exporter with Revit 2014, I noticed that the brand new rac_sample_project.rvt has some inconsistencies.

<p>I export the ClosedShells of the rooms into VRML format to display then in my browser.
On the left side you see overlapping room volumes from 'Hall' and 'Entry Hall':</p>

<p>'Kitchen and dining' has an upper edge that needs to be cut off:</p>

</center>

<p>'Hall' has two ears protruding into the sky:</p>

<img src="img/visual_debugging_3.png" alt="Hall with ears" width="300"/>
</center>

<p>I noticed this when debugging the funny results my application was producing.</p>

<p>Since it is not the code, I concluded it must be the input that was corruptedâ€¦</p>

<p>Without a visual tool like this, it is quite hard to evaluate what's wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Jeremy adds:</strong> You can also observe this using the Export &gt; gbXML command:</p>

<p>'Kitchen and dining' has an upper edge that needs to be cut off:</p>

</center>

<p>'Hall' has two ears protruding into the sky:</p>

<img src="img/visual_debugging_6.png" alt="Hall with ears" width="300"/>
</center>

<p>Furthermore, the Revit 2014 program folder contains a utility named <b>gbXML2dwfx.exe</b>.

<p>If you drag and drop a gbXML file onto this it will create a DWFx file that can be viewed in

<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/design-review">
Autodesk Design Review</a>,

the free 2D and 3D DWF viewer, which provides more functionality than many VRML viewers.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Interesting.
GbXML2Dwfx.exe appears to be new in Revit 2014.

<p>Regarding the geometry, it is important to note that you cannot rely on geometrical integrity of your Revit Elements.

<p>I faced this problem previously, not only with rooms but also with walls.

<p>Every cut-off and every Boolean operation makes the geometry more complex, and rounding errors may occur.

<p>This totally confirms the GiGo principle of
