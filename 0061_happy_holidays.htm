<h3>Happy Holidays</h3>

<p>I am taking a two-week break over the holiday season. Hurra!
My blog output will slow down or more probably stop completely during this time. 
I wish all the readers of "The Building Coder" the very best. 
Thank you for your support and readership over the past months. 
I have very much enjoyed writing for and communicating with you, and I am looking forward to a fun, productive and communicative 2009! :-)</p>
