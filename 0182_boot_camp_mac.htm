<h3>Revit Boot Camp on Mac</h3>

<!--
Autodesk Expands Support for Mac Users

Autodesk is now officially supporting Apple Boot Camp, a component of the Mac OSX operating system that enables customers to run Windows on their Apple Hardware, for users of AutoCAD 2010 software, 3ds Max 2010 software, 3ds Max Design 2010 software, Autodesk Inventor 2010 software, Autodesk Revit Architecture 2010 software, Autodesk Revit Structure 2010 software and Autodesk Revit MEP 2010 software.  A growing number of Autodesk customers are working in environments with Apple hardware and have requested support from Autodesk to use our design and engineering applications on that platform.    With Autodesk support for Boot Camp, customers can now run their favorite Mac applications and Autodesk applications on the same computer.   This will also enable customers to run Autodesk applications at full speed on a Mac and leverage its native graphics capabilities.  We know some customers have been successfully running their Autodesk software under Boot Camp for years, so we’re pleased to finally offer official support.  See www.autodesk.com/mac for more details.
