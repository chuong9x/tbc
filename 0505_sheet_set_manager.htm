<p>I thought we were very lucky in our travels around Europe so far, especially after hearing that one of the participants in the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/birthdays-and-gaps-in-shells.html">
Munich DevLab</a> had 

less luck.
He left the workshop, went to the airport, boarded, flew to Cologne, and was unable to land due to snow.
After nine hours of travelling he returned back to the starting point, to try it again another day.

<p>I mentioned our luck to my manager Gary Wassell, who responded that he put in an early request to the luck team for some extra luck for DevTech EMEA this year.
Well, unfortunately, it ran out.
I spent most of the day Saturday in the Milano Malpensa airport trying to fly to London Heathrow. 
The first flight was cancelled due to snow.
I was asked to wait for the second, and finally that was cancelled as well, so I packed up and took the train back in to town.
At least I did not have to fly there to find out and be sent back again!

<p>I rejoined my colleagues, Karl, Partha and Brian, who were scheduled to fly out on Sunday, and rescheduled my flight for Sunday morning.
Later in the evening we discovered that that Sunday morning flight was cancelled as well, and I rescheduled it again for the afternoon.
After hanging around all weekend waiting, it finally turns out now that there are no flights at all landing in England anymore, so we have been forced to cancel our part of the event.

<p>Luckily some of our UK colleagues will be able to take over the most important parts.
And I can finally return home tomorrow.
By train  :-)

<p>I have started settling back into normal life after the extensive conference tour and a whole month of non-stop travelling.
I still have not been able to start preparing Christmas, though, except for buying lots and lots of food to carry me and my grown-up  kids and their partners through the coming days.
I need to start thinking about presents now as well, I guess.

<p>I just had a meeting with my colleagues and heard of Adam's traumatic return journey from Milano to the UK this weekend. 
He finally made it, but it really was a bad journey.
The DevDay conference in the UK with Gary and Adam taking over all the presentations went very well, though.
Congratulations and thanks to Gary and Adam on managing that so competently!

comment</a> to point out that we missed the most exciting add-in, the sheet manager, so here is a little follow-up from Arthur to rectify that:

<h4>Sheet Manager &ndash; Менеджер листов</h4>

<p>This add-in organises sheets to albums. 
It controls its own numbering in each album. 
It uses a text shared parameter created by the user for numbering.  
In addition, the user can add specific parameters, which must be of the same value in each album. 
Sheet Manager monitors changes to these parameters and, if this parameter was specified to album, changes it to specified value. 
If it was parameter of album sheets numbering, the Sheet Manager controls renumbering of the other one.  
It allows user to move sheets up and down in albums. 
You can drop sheets from album to album by changing the appropriate parameter. 
Sheet Manager manipulates standard Revit parameters, so it easy to create standard Revit schedules and use other parameter based functions.</p>

<p>Actually, there is even more:

<h4>Copy Parameters &ndash; Копирование параметров</h4>

<p>Arthur created a new add-in named 

<a href="http://kartautodeskuser.blogspot.com/2010/12/blog-post_20.html">"Копирование параметров" (copy parameters)</a>. 
It copies instance parameters from one instance to others. 
It allows you to select which instance parameters you want to copy. 

<p>The user interface is minimal and intuitive.
There are only three buttons with the following Russian labels:

<ul>
<li>"Выбрать все" -  select all
<li>"Отменить выбор" - select none.
<li>"Копировать параметры" - copy parameters.
</ul>
