<h3>Public Revit 2011 SDK Posting</h3>

<p>The Revit 2011 SDK is now available on the public 

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">Revit Developer Center</a> site.

<p>Here are some of the last-minute changes documented between the beta version and this one:

<h5>Refactored Document properties related to transactions</h5>

<p>Two existing properties have been re-implemented to better complement the changes in the transaction framework:

<ul>
<li>Document.IsReadOnly indicates that a document is in read-only state, either temporarily or permanently. 
If it is read-only, new transactions may not be started in that document, and thus the model cannot be modified.

<li>Document.IsModifiable indicates whether a document is currently modifiable or not. 
A document is not modifiable if either there is no transaction currently open or due to some temporary state lock modification for a certain operation. 
Taken from another perspective, a transaction may be started only when document is not yet modifiable, and is also not read-only.
</ul>

<h5>FamilyHostingBehavior</h5>

<p>The FamilyHostingBehavior enumeration represents the type of host a family expects. The value for a particular family can be obtained from the family’s built-in parameter FAMILY_HOSTING_BEHAVIOR.

<h5>FamilyInstance.Host property improved</h5>

<p>The FamilyInstance.Host property will now return the host element of faced-hosted family instances. Previously it returned null.
