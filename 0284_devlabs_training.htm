<h3>DevLabs and Training</h3>

<p>Kean just pointed out that we have scheduled a number of new 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/01/more-devlabs-currently-planned-for-2010.html">
DevLabs</a> for this year. 

Two of them, in Munich and Beijing, will be offering support for Revit developers.

<p>We have also updated the 

<a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">
API training schedule</a> (which 

you can also access from the easy-to-remember URL

<a href="http://autodesk.com/apitraining">
autodesk.com/apitraining</a>).

It includes some class room trainings on the Revit API.
We are thinking of holding some webcasts on various aspects of the Revit API as well, and will add them to the training schedule once the plans have matured.

<!--
It includes three different Revit API trainings in Chennai, Beijing and Warsaw.
Please note that the dates for the training in Warsaw are currently in flux and therefore not yet listed correctly in the training schedule.
We are talking about adding an extra day to that training so that we can discuss the Revit MEP and Structure APIs as well as the basic Revit platform API, and moving it forward from April 28<sup>th</sup> to April 7-9.
