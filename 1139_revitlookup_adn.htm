<h4>AEC Technology Symposium</h4>

<p>I already pointed out the upcoming

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/no-devcamp-better-ny-aec-technology-symposium.html">AEC Technology Symposium</a> in

New York City on May 16-18.</p>

<p>I mentioned the bad news, the absence of our bi-annual AEC DevCamp this year, and the good news, namely our participation in this event.</p>

<p>The best news of all is that I will be able to participate myself, so I hope to see you in New York a month from now.</p>

<p>The symposium itself is held on Friday the 16th, followed by a

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">
Hackathon</a> over the weekend.</p>

<p>You can learn more and register for the event at

<a href="http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014">
http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to meet many of you that attended the AEC DevCamp in the past, and also get to know many new developers interested in cutting edge AEC technology, BIM 360, Dynamo, Revit, and non-Autodesk AEC technologies too.</p>

<h4>Autodesk University Germany 2014 Call for Proposals</h4>

<p>Besides the main Autodesk University event in Las Vegas, I am also hoping to attend the

<a href="https://cluster.ems-secure.de/registrations/autodesk/au.2014/ems.registration.php?s=main.summary.welcome&l=de&xid=8icbqrtfhpc93lu58imeuju7i4&tracking=D0000000000&s=main.summary.welcome">

<h4>Autodesk ReCap Connect Partnership Program</h4>

<p>You certainly know about ReCap, the reality capture functionality producing 3D point clouds and models from a series of 2D pixel images, e.g. normal camera snapshot photos.</p>

<p>Autodesk now announced the

<a href="http://inthefold.autodesk.com/in_the_fold/2014/04/autodesk-announces-recap-connect-partnership-program.html">
ReCap Connect Partnership Program</a> covering

several different methods to programmatically connect to and make use of this service:</p>

<ul>
<li>Capture Codec Kit</li>
<li>Embedded ReCap OEM program</li>
<li>ReCap Photo Web API</li>
</ul>

<h4>RevitLookup for Revit 2015 UR1</h4>

<p>I published

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/04/revitlookup-for-revit-2015.html">
RevitLookup for the Revit 2015 Meridian pre-release PR10</a> before

the final customer release, which ended up being UR1.</p>

<p>The complete source code, Visual Studio solution and add-in manifest, is provided in the

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup GitHub repository</a>,

and the new UR1 version is stored there as

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2015.0.0.1">release 2015.0.0.1</a>.</p>

<p>I changed nothing from the PR10 version, except updating the Revit API references, so the compilation obviously still generates the same

<a href="zip/revit_lookup_2015_warnings_02.txt">19 warnings</a> as before.</p>
