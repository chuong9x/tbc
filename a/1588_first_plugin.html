<h3>My First Revit Plugin Enhancements</h3>
<p>Today, let's return to the recurring topic of getting started with the Revit API, its SDK samples, and programming in general:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>My First Revit Plugin Enhancements</h4>
<p>A couple of people recently mentioned issues getting started with the Revit API, e.g. in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> threads
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-visual-studio-error-warnings/m-p/7357530/thread-id/24998">Revit API Visual Studio error/warnings</a> 
and <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/iexternalcommand-could-not-be-found/m-p/7386154">IExternalCommand could not be found</a>.</p>
<p>There are several ways to quickly get started with the Revit API, which I present as completely and succinctly as I can in
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2">getting started overview</a>.</p>
<p>The first problem you might encounter is getting your add-in loaded into Revit.</p>
<p>That is simple to resolve once you understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Once way is to follow
the <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-C574D4C8-B6D2-4E45-93A5-7E35B7E289BE">developer guide section on getting started</a> and
work through the hello world samples presented there.</p>
<p>Another way is to follow the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin"><em>My First Plugin</em> video tutorial</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/5126255">Elie Accari</a> very
kindly shared a couple of valuable enhancement suggestions for it in his thread 
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/my-first-plugin-quick-modification/m-p/7408596">My First Plugin &ndash; quick modification</a>:</p>
<p>I refer to the high entropy body of knowledge
in <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/myfirstrevitplugin">My First Plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Other threads mentioned issues some users are facing getting the plugin to work.</p>
<p>The above linked page includes a feedback email which has bounced back ("myfirstplugin wasn't found at autodesk.com"), so I am posting here in case new users seek to implement the same modification.</p>
<p><b><u>Issue #1:</u></b> Location of the Plugin</p>
<p>Not all users have access to the <code>AddIns</code> folder in <code>Program Files</code>, but all users have access to the <em>%AppData%\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\addins\<version></em> folder. If this is mentioned in the tutorial, it can reduce the number of questions asked.</p>
<p><b><u>Issue #2:</u></b> Unfamiliar Behaviour</p>
<p>The code does not properly copy the group. It just places it where you click, which could be in the middle of the other room. A more familiar way is to do a Copy-From:-To:. Only 3 lines of code including 2 modifications are required.</p>
<p><b><u>Modification #1:</u></b> Pick 2 points and calculate the distance between the two, instead of picking only 1 point.</p>
<p>To do so, replace the following code in the original lesson:</p>
<pre class="code">
  //Pick a point
  XYZ point = sel.PickPoint("Please pick a point to place group");
</pre>

<p>With the following:</p>
<pre class="code">
  //Pick a point
  XYZ pointFrom = sel.PickPoint("Pick a point to copy From");
  XYZ pointTo = sel.PickPoint("Pick a point to copy To");
  //Calculate the distance between the two points
  XYZ ptDist = pointTo - pointFrom;
</pre>

<p><b><u>Modification #2:</u></b> Use the Copy method instead of Place</p>
<p>Replace the following line between the <code>trans.Start</code> and <code>trans.Commit</code> lines:</p>
<pre class="code">
  doc.Create.PlaceGroup(point, group.GroupType);     
</pre>

<p>With this line:</p>
<pre class="code">
  ElementTransformUtils.CopyElement(doc, elem.Id, ptDist);
</pre>

<p>Finally, a suggestion: the text seem to entice Revit users into programming. In this regard, I would consider doing the following:</p>
<p>Add Lesson 0 (or renumber the lessons): Implement the same code in a macro using the Edit / SharpDevelop IDE readily accessible from inside Revit, without going to Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Then Lesson 1 could become: <em>Now let's do this again by converting this macro into an add-in</em>.</p>
<p>Ever so many thanks to Elie for his constructive criticism and extremely helpful advice and suggestions!</p>
<p>I passed it on to my colleagues for consideration next time the tutorial is re-recorded.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Getting Started with Web Programming &ndash; FreeCodeCamp</h4>

<h4><a name="4"></a>ModelessForm_ExternalEvent Initialisation</h4>
<p>Before closing, let me mention another little hint resolving an issue encountered
by <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2043172">Aziz</a> in 
the <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/modelessform-externalevent-sdk-sample/m-p/7370034">ModelessForm_ExternalEvent SDK sample</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am new to develop in Revit API getting started tutorials and all is going well until now, when I started with the SDK samples.</p>
<p>I am just trying to implement the <code>ModelessForm_ExternalEvent</code> sample, but it keeps throwing me an exception stating that <em>Object reference not set to an instance of an object</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> However, after more trials, I tried to change something and it did magically work. I created a class instance from but not assigning it a null value. I am sharing it below in case someone else is experiencing the same issue:</p>
<pre class="code">
  // class instance
  Public static Application thisApp = new Application();
</pre>
