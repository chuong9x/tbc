<p>Here is a last minute reminder that the 

<a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/?p=WEB229BU6PH7J9">
Revit API wish list survey</a>

that I already pointed out in a 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/07/api-wishlist-survey.html">
previous post</a> 

will be closing this Friday, <strong>July 31<sup>st</sup>, 2009</strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you very much to all of you who have already completed it!
The number of participants has increased significantly since last year, thanks to you.</p>

<p>Just to show you that the results of this wish list survey really do have a strong influence on the API development, here is the result of the previous Revit API wish list with the items implemented in Revit 2010 highlighted in bold:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ability to access more model data through the API</strong>
<li><strong>Ability to create new families programmatically (without using the family editor)</strong>
<li>Addition of event handlers for elements when added, deleted, changed, moved or selected</strong>
<li><strong>Ability to create more Revit elements programmatically</strong>
<li><strong>Improved documentation and sample code</strong>
<li>Better integration into Revit UI &ndash; popup menus, access to design bars and option bars, access to project browser</strong>
<li>Ability to let user select element ends, intersection and faces while external application is running inside of Revit</strong>
<li>Other (detail below, including any vertical needs)</strong>
<li>Ability to encode more complex formulas into family parameters</strong>
<li>Ability to change existing element behaviour, for example the join behaviour of a wall</strong>
<li><strong>Ability to create/edit/delete additional MEP elements</strong>
</ol>
