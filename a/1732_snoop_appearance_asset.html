  Following up on the comment I made whether you are restarting Revit. I did a write up on my blog that explains how you can use the Revit Add-In Manager to achieve the result you are after:
  http://archi-lab.net/debugging-revit-add-ins/
  The difference between this, and a standard method of debugging is that Revit loads the DLL using the LoadFrom() method, locking it up for as long as the Revit.exe process is on, while the Add-In Manager uses the Load() method that only reads the byte[] of the DLL which means its available, and you can re-build your solution in VS, and reload in Revit without closing it. It does have drawbacks obviously so please read the post.

<h4><a name="3"></a> Debug and Continue in a Revit Add-In</h4>
<p>Developers are continuously seeking reliable, efficient development approaches.
Some ways have been described in the past implementing the functionality
to <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.49">edit and continue, and debug without restarting</a>.</p>
<p>This question arose again in the StackOverflow question
asking <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55256817/why-is-my-dll-still-being-used-by-revit-after-execution">why is my DLL still being used by Revit after execution?</a>.</p>
<p>Konrad Sobon jumped in and pointed out his solution:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Snooping Appearance Assets</h4>
<p>In further support of efficient debugging and Revit database exploration, here is
another <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a> enhancement
enabling snooping of appearance assets, based on two pull requests 
by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003616852588">Victor Chekalin</a>, aka Виктор Чекалин:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/48">#48 &ndash; snoop rendering <code>AssetProperty</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/49">#49 &ndash; pushed the missed files</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/50">#50 &ndash; handle <code>AssetPropertyDoubleArray4d</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The description is sweet and simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snoop rendering <code>AssetProperty</code> &ndash; <code>Material</code> &rarr; <code>AppearanceAssetId</code> &rarr; <code>GetRenderingAssset</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is supported by more than a thousand words:</p>

<p>Many thanks to Victor for this useful enhancement!</p>
