### TextNote Rotation, Forge DevCon, TensorFlow and Keras

The Forge DevCon developer conference has been happily united with Autodesk University, text note rotation is easy, and I continued my deep learning exploration for implementing a Revit API question answering system:

- [Forge DevCon at AU](#2)
- [Setting `TextNote` rotation](#3)
- [TensorFlow and Keras](#4)
- [Updating restricted Python packages](#5)
- [Rules of machine learning](#6)


####<a name="2"></a>Forge DevCon at AU

A match made in heaven:
the [Forge DevCon](https://forge.autodesk.com/DevCon) developer
conference has been happily united
with [Autodesk University](http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas)

A lot of synergy is gained connecting the two.

The last DevCon in 2016 was held in San Francisco and was a great success.

We plan to make it bigger and better still this year, and moving it to Las Vegas for 2017 will help.

It will take place on November 13-14,
i.e., [Monday and Tuesday of the Autodesk University week](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2017/01/forge-devcon-change-of-date-and-venue.html).

In previous years, these were the days on which we hosted the DevDay and DevLab conference and open house support hackathon for application developers.

This is a good thing.

Somewhat selfishly, it means less travel for those of us coming across from Europe.

It will also make AU a more compelling, developer-centric event.

Now nobody has to choose between DevCon and DevDays + AU. Itâ€™s all together in one place.




####<a name="3"></a>Setting TextNote Rotation

Rotating a text note is very easy, both during creation and when modifying existing elements.

One little complication for existing add-ins is introduced by fact that the approach changed with
the [`TextNote` API overhaul in Revit 2016](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html#4.02):

**Question:** In Revit 2015, I used the method:

<pre class="code">
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNote</span>&nbsp;text&nbsp;=&nbsp;doc.Create.NewTextNote(&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;view,&nbsp;origin,&nbsp;baseVec,&nbsp;upVec,&nbsp;lineWidth,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextAlignFlags</span>.TEF_ALIGN_CENTER&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextAlignFlags</span>.TEF_ALIGN_MIDDLE,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;strText&nbsp;);
</pre>

for creating a text note.
 
As this method has been replaced with `TextNote.Create`, I can create a text note using:

<pre class="code">
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNote</span>&nbsp;text&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNote</span>.Create(&nbsp;doc,&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;view.Id,&nbsp;&nbsp;origin,&nbsp;strText,&nbsp;texttypeID&nbsp;);
</pre>

But how do I set its rotation when creating it?
 
Also, how do I change the rotation of existing text notes?

**Answer:** To rotate the `TextNote` as it is placed, one of the overloads for `TextNote.Create` uses `TextNoteOptions` and its `Rotation` option:
 
<pre class="code">
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNoteOptions</span>&nbsp;tno&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNoteOptions</span>();
  tno.Rotation&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.5&nbsp;*&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Math</span>.PI;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;in&nbsp;Radians</span>
  tno.TypeId&nbsp;=&nbsp;texttypeID;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;include&nbsp;text&nbsp;type</span>
   
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNote</span>&nbsp;text&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNote</span>.Create(&nbsp;doc,&nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;view.Id,&nbsp;origin,&nbsp;strText,&nbsp;tno&nbsp;);
</pre>

**Response:** This is how I managed to create the rotated text aligned with existing curve based elements:
 
<pre class="code">
  <span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;get&nbsp;the&nbsp;curve&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;element</span>
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">Curve</span>&nbsp;curve&nbsp;=&nbsp;(&nbsp;(<span style="color:#2b91af;">LocationCurve</span>)&nbsp;elem.Location&nbsp;)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;.Curve;
   
  <span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;get&nbsp;start&nbsp;and&nbsp;end&nbsp;point&nbsp;of&nbsp;pipe</span>
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">XYZ</span>&nbsp;PipeEnd&nbsp;=&nbsp;curve.GetEndPoint(&nbsp;1&nbsp;);
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">XYZ</span>&nbsp;PipeStart&nbsp;=&nbsp;curve.GetEndPoint(&nbsp;0&nbsp;);
   
  <span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;get&nbsp;vector&nbsp;representing&nbsp;the&nbsp;pipe</span>
  <span style="color:#2b91af;">XYZ</span>&nbsp;v&nbsp;=&nbsp;PipeEnd&nbsp;-&nbsp;PipeStart;
   
  <span style="color:blue;">double</span>&nbsp;angle&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Math</span>.Atan2(&nbsp;v.Y,&nbsp;v.X&nbsp;);

  <span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;testOptions&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNoteOptions</span>()
  {
  &nbsp;&nbsp;HorizontalAlignment&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">HorizontalTextAlignment</span>.Center,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Rotation&nbsp;=&nbsp;angle,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;TypeId&nbsp;=&nbsp;texttypeID
  };
   
  <span style="color:blue;">var</span>&nbsp;text&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">TextNote</span>.Create(&nbsp;doc,&nbsp;view.Id,
  &nbsp;&nbsp;origin,&nbsp;strText,&nbsp;testOptions&nbsp;);
</pre>

####<a name="4"></a>TensorFlow and Keras

Continuing my superficial browsing of various open source possibilities on which to base a question answering system for the Revit API add-in programming, I now bumped
into [TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow)
([web site](https://www.tensorflow.org/),
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)).

It converts the learning matter to vectors and computes similarities, learning best matches by assigning weight using various algorithms.

Here are a bunch of interesting TensorFlow tutorial and other related texts that I would all like to work through in greater depth anon:

- [MNIST tutorial for beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index) and [advanced](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/pros/index)
- [Vector Representations of Words](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec/)
- [Recurrent Neural Networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/recurrent/)
- [Sequence-to-Sequence Models](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq/)
- [TensorKart: self-driving MarioKart with TensorFlow](http://kevinhughes.ca/blog/tensor-kart)

They also led to further papers and the [Keras](https://keras.io) system built on top of it:

- [SyntaxNet](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/syntaxnet/) is a neural-network Natural Language Processing framework for TensorFlow.
- [Question Answering Using Deep Learning](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/StrohMathur.pdf) &ndash; neural network variants are becoming the dominant architecture for many NLP tasks. This project applies several deep learning approaches to question answering, with a focus on the bAbI dataset, including TensorFlow.
- [Keras: Deep Learning library for Theano and TensorFlow](https://keras.io/) &ndash; paper on [Deep Language Modelling for Question Answering using Keras](http://benjaminbolte.com/blog/2016/keras-language-modeling.html) with [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/babi_rnn.py)
- [Question answering on the Facebook bAbi dataset using recurrent neural networks and 175 lines of Python + Keras](http://smerity.com/articles/2015/keras_qa.html)
- [The Facebook bAbI tasks](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/)

I decided to install these packages, which led to an interesting problem that took a while to sort out and seems worthwhile documenting for future reference.


####<a name="5"></a>Updating Restricted Python Packages

TensorFlow and Keras are Python based.

Installation is very straightforward and easy.

TensorFlow requires several other base packages: `six`, `funcsigs`, `pbr`, `mock`, `numpy`, `protobuf`.

Unfortunately, on my system, some of these were out of date and the system refused to allow me to update them.

For instance, calling `$ pip install tensorflow` led to a conflict due to the existence of prior versions of `six` and `numpy`.

After some research, I determined that I could resolve the issues by simply deleting the associated files.

Unfortunately, this is not permitted by the system, as described in the question
on [why `chown` reports `operation not permitted` on OS X](http://superuser.com/questions/279235/why-does-chown-report-operation-not-permitted-on-os-x).

The short description of the solution for this is given there:

> System Integrity Protection (rootless) ... boot into Recovery Mode (Cmd-R), run `csrutil disable`, then restart; to reenable, use `csrutil enable`.

It is explained in greater detail in the StackOverflow question
on [restricted folder and files in OS X El Capitan](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30768087/restricted-folder-files-in-os-x-el-capitan):

> To temporarily disable SIP (System Integrity Protection):

> - Reboot

> - As soon as you hear the "Mac sound" on the grey screen, press Cmd+R to enter Recovery mode

> - Open Utilities &gt; Terminal

> - Run the command `csrutil disable`

> - Reboot, you'll land in the normal OS with SIP disabled

> - Do all the changes you'd like to do

> - Reboot again

> - As soon as you hear the "Mac sound" on the grey screen, press Cmd+R to enter Recovery mode

> - Enable SIP with `csrutil enable`

> - Reboot again

> - Done

On my system, the problematic packages live in the folder

- `System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python`

You can examine their restricted status using `ls`:

<pre>
&#36; &#108;s -lhdO num*
drwxr-xr-x  36 root  wheel  restricted             1.2K May 25  2016 numpy
-rw-r--r--   1 root  wheel  restricted,compressed  1.6K Aug  1  2015 numpy-1.8.0rc1-py2.7.egg-info
</pre>

By temporarily disabling SIP, I was finally able to move them out of the way and continue normal installation:

<pre>
&#36; sudo -H pip install tensorflow
</pre>

With TensorFlow in place, I successfully ran the standard Python install in the `keras` folder and immediately executed one of its interesting examples:

<pre>
/a/src/deep_learning &#36; cd kears
/a/src/deep_learning/keras &#36; sudo python setup.py install
/a/src/deep_learning/keras &#36; cd examples
/a/src/deep_learning/keras/examples &#36; python babi_rnn.py
</pre>

What shall I do next?

Here are two descriptions of successful experiments implementing minimal question answering systems with it that I am taking a deeper look at:

- [Deep Language Modelling for Question Answering using Keras](http://benjaminbolte.com/blog/2016/keras-language-modeling.html)
  ([^](/a/doc/deep_learning/keras/Deep_Language_Modeling_for_Question_Answering_using_Keras.pdf)),
  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/codekansas/keras-language-modeling)
- [Question Answering Using Deep Learning](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/StrohMathur.pdf)
  ([^](/a/doc/deep_learning/keras/Question_Answering_Using_Deep_Learning_by_Stroh_Mathur.pdf)),
  [GitHub repo](https://github.com/priyank87/memn2n)
  
Time for me to get going putting together some Revit API related tests?


####<a name="6"></a>Rules of Machine Learning

By the way, before doing anything else, I and everybody else interested in machine learning ought to read and ponder
Martin Zinkevich's 43 [Rules of Machine Learning](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf),
split up into useful consecutive phases:

- Before Machine Learning
- Phase I: Your First Pipeline
    - Monitoring
    - Your First Objective
- Phase II: Feature Engineering
    - Human Analysis of the System
    - Training-Â­Serving Skew
- Phase III: Slowed Growth, Optimization Refinement, and Complex Models

To quote Martin:

> The document is arranged in four parts:

>- The first part should help you understand whether the time is right for building a machine learning system.

>- The second part is about deploying your first pipeline.

>- The third part is about launching and iterating while adding new features to your pipeline, how to evaluate models and training-Â­serving skew.

>- The final part is about what to do when you reach a plateau.

>- Afterwards, there is a list of related work and an appendix with some background on the systems commonly used as examples in this document.

It is strongly geared towards ranking.
