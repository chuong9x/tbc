  I read your blog: https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#4
  Regarding your mac book having heat problems. It’s good you cleaned the fans. What you could also look into is if this is also possible for a mac:

  basically, I lower the voltage to my CPU to the point it is just stable, and with that reduction, I can run the processor at a higher clock speed.

<h3>BIM365 Getting Started, Visual Appearance and CPU Voltage</h3>
<p>As mentioned, I am on vacation right now, coamping on the coast of the Atlantic, enjoying splendid weather.</p>
<p>Here are a few items that cropped up and are worth mentioning anyway:</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a> Getting Started with Revit API and Programming Buttons</h4>
<p>Zach Smith reached out and pointed to his new
blogging platform <a href="https://www.bim365.tech">BIM365</a> together
with collaborators Matt Boltik and Andrell Laniewicz:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>His first two posts are of interest to all:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.bim365.tech/blog/programming-buttons-in-revit-b7bjm">Getting Started with Revit API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bim365.tech/blog/programming-buttons-in-revit">Programming Buttons in Revit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Welcome to the Revit API blogosphere and thank you for sharing, Zach!</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Links to API to Modify Visual Appearance of Materials</h4>
<p>For the sake of completeness, here is a new link to the information presented by Boris Shafiro at Autodesk University 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/New-API-Modify-Visual-Appearance-Materials-Revit-2017">New API to Modify Visual Appearance of Materials in Revit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Building Coder presented some of the material in the discussion
on <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/11/modifying-material-visual-appearance.html">modifying material visual appearance</a>.</p>
<p>This new link includes the full collection of class materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview</li>
<li>Video &ndash; 45 minutes</li>
<li>Handout &ndash; 21 pages</li>
<li>Presentation &ndash; 33 slides</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="4"></a> Improving Performance by Optimising CPU Voltage</h4>
<p>Daniel Gijsbers noticed my descriptionand solution to the
of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#4">MacBook Pro overheating problem</a> and
very kindly responded:</p>

<p>What you could also look into is
whether <a href="https://danielgijsbers.blogspot.com/2018/10/performance.html">improving performance by optimising CPU voltage</a> is
also possible for a mac.
