  Q
  Is there an addin wizard for Revit 2021?
  A: Thank you for your motivating question. Nope, I have not migrated it yet. You asking for it significantly raises the chances of it happening soon, though.
  Alternatively, of course, you can fork the repo, migrate it, and submit a pull request to share with the rest of the community. Thank you!

Dear Cflux,

Thank you for your motivating question. Nope, I have not migrated it yet. You asking for it significantly raises the chances of it happening soon, though.

Alternatively, of course, you can fork the repo, migrate it, and submit a pull request to share with the rest of the community. Thank you!

Cheers, Jeremy.

Dear Jeremy, Thank you for the swift reply. I'll look into it. I've never done something like that before but I can take look and give it a shot. Are there any simple instructions I can follow for the migration?

For the migration, I imagine i just go in and change all of the years from "2020" to "2021"? Hopefully it's that easy, let me know.

The reason I ask about it is because Revit download trials are only of their most recent year. You can now only get 2020, 2019, and 2019 if you either purchase or have an educational license; neither of which I have unfortunately and the Revit LT version doesn't allow addins.

Dear Jeremy, I just submitted the pull request. i just changed the 2020s to 2021s (years only) and then changed to .Net framework from v4.7 to v4.8. That was my first ever pull request so hopefully it goes smoothly. let me know. you can reach me through github as well.

- invisible Revit properties in Forge viewer
Eason Kang Today at 11:29 AM
Hi again team, I got a question from a Revit user. He said one of his family parameters is missing after translation. While opening the family document inside the RVT, I found the missing parameter has a Visible: false in its definition with Revit Lookup tool. Does this mean that Revit extractor will ignore invisible parameters while exporting PropertyDB? Thank you in advance! (edited)

A: Yes indeed, Revit Extractor only handles visible parameters          InternalDefinition^ idef = dynamic_cast<InternalDefinition^>(paramDef);
         if (idef)
         {
            if (!idef->Visible)
            {
               continue;
            }
