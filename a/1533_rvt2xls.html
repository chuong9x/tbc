RVT Properties to XLS and Forge Accelerators #RevitAPI @AutodeskRevit #aec #bim #dynamobim @AutodeskForge http://bit.ly/rvt2xls

Are you interested in easy access to your Revit model properties?
Well, you can have that even without a need to install Revit.
The Forge Model Derivative API extracts a streamlined copy of all geometry, BIM element hierarchy and properties from over fifty file formats, and Revit RVT files are just one of them.
Augusto Goncalves implemented a Forge sample to read all the properties on all BIM elements in an RVT file and export them to an XLSX spreadsheet
&ndash; Test run it yourself
&ndash; Source code on GitHub...

<h3>RVT Properties to XLS and Forge Accelerators</h3>
<p>Are you interested in easy access to your Revit model properties?</p>
<p>Well, you can have that, and you can even do so without a need to install Revit.</p>
<p>The Forge <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/">Model Derivative API</a> extracts
a streamlined copy of all geometry, BIM element hierarchy and properties from over fifty file formats, and Revit RVT files are just one of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=augusto%20goncalves">Augusto Goncalves</a> implemented
the <code>viewer-javascript-extract.spreadsheet</code> Forge sample to read all the properties on all BIM elements in an RVT file and export them to an XLSX spreadsheet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://autodesk-forge.github.io/viewer-javascript-extract.spreadsheet">Test run it yourself</a></li>

<li><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/create-spreadsheet-excel-client-translated-revit-files">Blog post announcement</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That's pretty neat, I think.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Augusto for putting that together.</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Upcoming Forge Accelerators</h4>
<p>We have twoÂ <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/">Forge accelerators</a> coming up in Europe
in the <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/prague-2/">next couple of months</a>:</p>

<li>Gothenburg, Sweden &ndash; March 27-30</li>
<li>Barcelona, Spain &ndash; June 12-16</li>
</ul>

</center></p>
<p>I am planning on attending both of these and would love to see you there too.</p>
<p>In fact, the complete EMEA DevTech Team will be present to support you over the course of the week.</p>
<p>They take place in the Autodesk offices with lots of space and cool recreation areas.</p>
<p>Attendance is free of charge &ndash; all you pay for is your travel, accommodation and living expenses.  </p>
<p>You can still apply to participate in either of these two events by sending your Forge App development project ideas to <a href="mailto:adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com">adn-training-worldwide@autodesk.com</a>.</p>
<p>More information is available at <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com">autodeskcloudaccelerator.com</a></p>
<p>Check out the videos on the landing page to hear what great results the attendees at previous accelerators achieved after just one week of intensive teamwork and training.</p>
<p>Please note that space is limited to two persons per company.</p>
