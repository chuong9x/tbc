- On Putting the ‘I’ Into Revit, BIM | 01: Getting Rid of ‘Text’

  by Jay B Zallan
  > Why do we want No Text? One reason is that if the information is not embedded into a corresponding object (as long as one exists, lol) it is not BIM. That is called drafting and has no place in Revit or BIM. It is and would be like putting hay into the gas tank of a Ferrari... a little tinge of “well, we’ve always done it that way and it always worked fine fueling the horses” ...need I speculate as to how that Ferrari is doing?

<p>Quote of the Week: <i>Today, most software exists, not to solve a problem, but to interface with other software.</i> &ndash; Ian Angell</p>
</center></p>
<p>Especially applicable to Forge, BIM360, Design Automation for Revit, and all the other cloud-based workflows evolving today.</p>
<p>People no longer buy amplifiers, beause Sonos lourdpeakers are driven straight from the Internet, grab the music tracks to play from there, are controlled through a smaprtphone app.</p>
<p>Imagine streamlining and automating building construction and maintenance in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>Significant parts of these tasks are still hands-on, of course; however, an inordinate amount of effort is wasted by inefficient and outdatad management processes driving (or failing to) those hands-on parts of the job.</p>
