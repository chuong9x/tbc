Reference Stable Representation Magic Voodoo #revitAPI #3dwebcoder @AutodeskRevit #adsk #aec #bim #python #dynamobim

Let's end the week with a truly magnificent contribution and research result provided by Scott Wilson in the the Revit API discussion forum.
Scott responded to Pat Hague's recent thread on converting local family instance coordinate of a selected edge to project coordinates, saying,
Yeah the Stable Reference Strings can be used to get at areas of the Geometry API that aren't fully exposed &ndash; I love playing around with them. Sometimes I stumble upon something cool such as this solution for a situation in which the geometry returns no reference for a family instance...

<p>Here's a summary of my investigations into stable reference strings created using <code>Reference.ConvertToStableRepresentation</code> and the Voodoo Magic that they can perform.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Analysis and Background Information</h4>
<p>A reference stable representation string is a collection of UniqueIds combined with table indices, delimited by the colon <code>:</code> character.</p>
<p>A reference string for a <code>PlanarFace</code> of a <code>FamilyInstance</code> element &ndash; accessed through its <code>GetSymbolGeometry</code> method &ndash; looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  66a421da-90cb-4df2-8efe-c312e4f78aa0-0003d32b:0:INSTANCE:a2177cbb-03d8-4416-a4d8-8ada6fc0165a-0003ebf0:78:SURFACE
</pre>

<p>The string obtained from the reference of the same face accessed using <code>GetInstanceGeometry</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre>
  a2177cbb-03d8-4416-a4d8-8ada6fc0165a-0003ebf0:78:SURFACE
</pre>

<p>As you can see, this is identical to the last 3 sections of the symbol geometry reference.</p>
<p>The SymbolGeometry reference looks like 2 references of 3 tokens each.</p>
<p>The structured data contained in the string can be used to reliably access geometry objects that are not completely exposed by the API.</p>
<p>This is done by building a custom string using parts of an existing valid string obtained from the API.</p>
<p>The fist step is to tokenise the string:</p>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">string</span> refString = myReference
&nbsp; &nbsp; .ConvertToStableRepresentation( dbDoc );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">string</span>[] refTokens = refString.Split(
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="blue">char</span>[] { <span class="maroon">':'</span> } );
</pre>

<p>This will give you an array of string tokens.</p>
<p>Here is my interpretation of each token's purpose &ndash; I could be wrong on some of them, as I've just inferred this information through experimentation, using symbol geometry string as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>token0: 66a421da-90cb-4df2-8efe-c312e4f78aa0-0003d32b - UniqueId of the FamilyInstance Element.</li>
<li>token1: 0 - Presumably an index into a collection within the FamilyInstance (I've not seen anything other than zero here so it could be that the collection always contains a single entry, or that other entries have some other special unknown use)</li>
<li>token2: INSTANCE - signals that the referenced geometry object belongs to A FamilyInstance Element.</li>
<li>token3: a2177cbb-03d8-4416-a4d8-8ada6fc0165a-0003ebf0 - UniqueId of the FamilySymbol Instance that describes the geometry of this FamilyInstance (multiple FamilyInstances that have identical Geometry will reference the same FamilySymbol Instance.</li>
<li>token4: 78 - the index of the referenced geometry object within the FamilySymbol Instance's geometry table. index positions 0 through 8 are reserved for the special reference planes that have been specified in the family editor (explained later).</li>
<li>token5: SURFACE - the type of geometry object referenced by this string.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the best way to try to follow the hierarchy is to read the tokens in reverse order as follows:</p>
<p>The referenced geometry object of type: SURFACE is at index: 78 of the FamilySymbol Instance with UniqueId: a2177cbb-03d8-4416-a4d8-8ada6fc0165a-0003ebf0 as represented by the FamilyInstance with UniqueId: 66a421da-90cb-4df2-8efe-c312e4f78aa0-0003d32b.</p>
<p>It bothers me that references from geometry objects accessed through <code>GetSymbolGeometry</code> specify the FamilyInstance while those from <code>GetInstanceGeometry</code> do not, yet the <code>GetInstanceGeometry</code> objects will be correctly transformed into project coordinates according to the FamilyInstance, where the <code>GetSymbolGeometry</code> objects are left in family coordinate space. This seems a little backwards to me.</p>
<p>Another strange behaviour is that the ElementId property of the reference from an object returned by <code>GetInstanceGeometry</code> does not even match the FamilyInstance it came from &ndash; it actually refers to the FamilySymbol instance instead.</p>
<p>Now for the Voodoo Magic that I promised:</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Voodoo Magic</h4>
<p>If you have a reference in SymbolGeometry format, as obtained from a Dimension or through the <code>Selection.PickObject</code> method, and you need to get the geometry object in its correct position according to the FamilyInstance, you can tokenise the reference string as demonstrated above and then rebuild it as an InstanceGeometry reference string by discarding the first 3 tokens and joining the remaining 3 using, ':' as the delimiter.</p>
<p>You then obtain the InstanceGeometry from the element linked to the original reference and loop through it until you find an object that has a stable reference string that exactly matches your custom made one.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, the first 9 positions are occupied by the special references that have been allocated in the family editor, with the following magic values:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 = Left</li>
<li>1 = Center Left/Right</li>
<li>2 = Right</li>
<li>3 = Front</li>
<li>4 = Centre Front/Back</li>
<li>5 = Back</li>
<li>6 = Bottom</li>
<li>7 = Center Elevation</li>
<li>8 = Top</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this sequence matches the order they appear in the family editor reference type drop-down list.</p>
<p>These references are handy for creating Dimensions, but the API does not expose them fully. They exist in the element geometry but have the generic type of GeometryObject with no indication of their special purpose other than the index found in the reference string. To get one of these references, all you need to do is get any geometry object from the FamilyInstance using <code>GetSymbolGeometry</code> and use it's reference string as a template to build a custom reference that points to the special reference.</p>
<p>You just need to tokenise the reference string and replace <code>token4</code> with the index value from the list above for the reference you want.</p>
<p><code>token5</code> should also be Replaced with <code>SURFACE</code>, but I've found that you can safely leave out the last token and the reference string will still be valid.</p>
<p>To simplify things, I created an enumeration for the indices and a static method that simplifies the process:</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; CenterFB = 4,

<p>There's a little bit of unnecessary code in that method, as it was quickly cobbled together from the code I was using for research, sorry.</p>
<p>That's all I have for now.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone finds it useful.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Wow!</p>
<p>I am sure we will!</p>
<p>A number of people commented on Scott's original post and were extremely impressed, overawed even, by this analysis and truly magical voodoo.</p>
<p>So am I!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Scott for all his research, creating, sharing, documenting this, many other solutions, all the support and profound insights he provides so selflessly in the discussion forum!</p>
