<p>It expands on previous presentations on <em>Connecting BIM on Desktop and Cloud</em> and <em>Freeing your BIM Data</em>.</p>
<p>The full documentation on this class including the English language handout document and slide deck is available from The Building Coder post on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/10/rational-bim-programming-at-au-darmstadt.html">Rational BIM Programming at AU Darmstadt</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Pleasant Walks in the Odenwald</h4>
<p>In Darmstadt, I was also able to pay a visit my good old friend George and talk of many things... "of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--of cabbages--and kings" [cf. <a href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html">The Walrus and The Carpenter</a> by Lewis Carroll].</p>
<p>We also took several walks in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odenwald">Odenwald</a> with his dog Leo:</p>

</center></p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Some of My Favourite Recent Books</h4>
<p>Here are some of the books I recently read and enjoyed more than others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noam Shpancer: <em>The Good Psychologist</em> [en] &ndash; a loving, intelligent, illuminating story of a psychologist in practice and teaching, on practical therapy and theory, interwoven with his own personal love story, loneliness and yearning.</li>
<li>Juli Zeh: <em>Unter Leuten</em> [de] &ndash; utterly brilliant, loving, deeply psychological and fascinating story about different realities and conflict that the people of a small village create by misunderstanding and for mutual manipulation.</li>
<li>Bernhard Jaumann: <em>Die Vipern von Montesecco</em> [de] &ndash; a brilliant whodunnit in a small Italian village with everybody under suspicion and the village wholeheartedly determined to solve this to preserve its sense of unity, and solve it with no outside interference.</li>
<li>Antonio Manzini: <em>Non e stagione</em> [it] &ndash; un giallo, exciting detective story featuring Rocco Schiavione, a totally hip super macho cop from Rome transferred to Aosta and unhappy with snow in May, trying to save an abandoned kidnapped girl from dying.</li>
<li>Antonio Manzini: <em>Pista nera</em> [it] &ndash; I love Rocco Schiavione and Antonio Manzini; radical militant violent personal integrity, regardless of law and order, serving a higher and personal truth.</li>
<li>Antonio Manzini: <em>La costola di Adamo</em> [it] &ndash; more radical personal integrity; the topic is political and sociological, femmicide; read the last sentence of the acknowledgements before starting the book; cf. this <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/change-type-iterate-elements-create-family.html#5">quote and my translation</a>.</li>
<li>Antonio Manzini: <em>Era di maggio</em> [it] &ndash; number four in this series.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Where to Continue After Finishing School</h4>
<p>Another topic that came up with several friends and their kids is what to do after finishing school.</p>
<p>Here are my three current favourite education options:</p>
<ul>
<li>For people who are unsure what they want: <a href="http://www.knowmads.nl">Knowmads Creative International Business School</a></li>
<li>For young people who know that they want to learn programming in depth: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)">42</a>, a private, non-profit and tuition-free computer programming school with campuses in Paris and <a href="https://www.42.us.org">Silicon Valley</a></li>
<li>For anyone wishing to quickly and efficiently launch a web programming oriented career from scratch: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freecodecamp.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My son attended Knowmads a couple of years ago, and now another friend's daughter is there as well, and extremely enthusiastic about it.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>New AlphaGo Zero is Completely Self-Taught</h4>
<p>The AI research community has been very excited indeed lately by the super-human level of performance achieved by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo">AlphaGo</a>, by learning from a combination of human knowledge and self-generated experience:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/bim-programming-madrid-and-spanish-connectivity.html#7">AlphaGo beats grand master</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/ai-news-and-sub-transaction-regen.html#2">AlphaGo beats world champion</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>New research has taken it yet another step further, and 
now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16495548/deepmind-ai-go-alphago-zero-self-taught">DeepMind's Go-playing AI doesn't need human help to beat us anymore</a>
&ndash; the latest AlphaGo AI learned superhuman skills by playing itself over and over.</p>
<p>Here is a two-and-a-half-minute video about AlphaGo <a href="https://youtu.be/mJ4tEDMksWA">discovering new knowledge</a>:</p>

<h4><a name="7"></a>TotalPressureLoss Units</h4>
<p>Back to the Revit API, and a question in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> 
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/totalpressureloss-units/m-p/7452507"><code>TotalPressureLoss</code> units</a>:</p>
<p>I'm using <code>MEPSection.TotalPressureLoss</code> to get the pressure drop of the section.</p>
<p>The Revit UI tells me, in this example, the pressure drop is 5853Pa.</p>
<p>When I get the value using the API, or Revit Lookup, I get the number 1784.0906645432:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/TotalPressureLoss_units.jpg" alt="TotalPressureLoss units" width="712"/>
</center></p>
<p>What units is this value in?</p>
<p>The API documentation on
the <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/f75e82be-d681-544c-641f-c943765ef2be.htm">TotalPressureLoss property</a> says,
"default unit is Kgf per square feet", which has got to be the weirdest unit of pressure ever, but whatever.</p>
<p>When I convert 5853Pa to Kgf/Ft^2 I get 55.45, so that can't be the correct unit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=convert+5853+pascals+to+kgf%2Fft%5E2">WolfranAlpha convert 5853 pascals to kgf/ft^2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>I know it's standard for Revit to convert to some pretty weird units, that's why I'm trying to figure out what this one is. </p>
<p><center> 
<p style="font-size:larger"><code>5853Pa</code></p>
</center></p>
<p>It's not:</p>
<ul>
<li>feet of head (1.958)</li>
<li>or inwg (23.497)</li>
<li>or psi (.8498)</li>
<li>or in Hg (1.728)</li>
<li>or cmHg (4.39)</li>
<li>or atm (.05766)</li>
<li>or bars (58.53)</li>
</ul>
<p>Which is all the units that Revit supports as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>It's also not:</p>
<ul>
<li>lbf/yard^2 (1100)</li>
<li>or N/yard^2 (4894)</li>
<li>or N/foot^2 (543.8)</li>
<li>or N/barn (5.853 x 10^-25)</li>
<li>or ozf/in^2 (13.58)</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess it's RPU or Revit Pressure Units or a bug in the code?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The development team responds:</p>
<p>Sorry for the hassle.</p>
<p>It should be:</p>
<p><center>
(kg ft / s^2 ) / ft ^2 or kg / (ft s^2)
</center></p>
<p>The best bet for anyone getting values from Revit parameters which are in a more complicated unit than length is to use the <code>UnitUtils</code> method <code>ConvertFromInternalUnits</code> to the display unit type you want.</p>
