What Can Revit on the Cloud Do For You? #revitAPI #3dwebcoder @AutodeskRevit @adskForge #3dwebaccel #a360 #bim

Dear Revit API Add-in Developer Community, this is The Building Coder Post nr. 1400! 1400 is the number of different arrangements of four non-attacking queens on a 4×10 chessboard.
I am using this happy special occasion to ask you an important and hopefully very popular question: What Can Revit on the Cloud Do For You?
Would you like to run Revit on a Server?
Are you looking for a Revit I/O, similar to AutoCAD I/O?
What does Revit on the Cloud look like in your dreams?
Could you make use of RealRVT, something similar to RealDWG, to programmatically access, create and modify a complete BIM without installing Revit?

<h3>What Can Revit on the Cloud Do For You?</h3>
<p>Dear Revit API Add-in Developer Community, this is The Building Coder</p>
<p><center>
<p style="font-size: 150%; font-weight: bold">Post nr. 1400!</p>
</center></p>
<p>By the way, 1400 is the number of different arrangements of
four <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/QueensProblem.html">non-attacking queens</a> on
a 4×10 chessboard, cf. <a href="http://www2.stetson.edu/~efriedma/numbers.html">What's Special About This Number?</a></p>

<p>I am using this happy special occasion to ask you a really special, important and hopefully very popular question:</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a>What Can Revit on the Cloud Do For You?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Would you like to run Revit on a Server?</li>
<li>Are you looking for a Revit I/O, similar to <a href="http://autocad.io">AutoCAD I/O</a>?</li>
<li>What does Revit on the Cloud look like in your dreams?</li>
<li>Could you make use of RealRVT, something similar to <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/realdwg">RealDWG</a> to programmatically access, create and modify a complete BIM without installing Revit?</li>
</ul>
<p>Autodesk would like to learn more about what you want, what you need, and why.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://forge.autodesk.com">Autodesk Forge</a> web
services API effort, we are looking closely at what developers want from a Cloud/Server based Revit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need to do batch processing of Revit Projects or Families?</li>
<li>Want to create PDFs of Revit Sheets by batch every night?</li>
<li>Want to search through Revit projects for missing attributes or unapproved Families?</li>
<li>Want to drive Revit from a web page or a database?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the time to talk to us about your needs for Revit on the Cloud, we would love to do so and take a closer look at what developers would want from a Revit I/O, or Revit on the Cloud.</p>
<p>We are thinking of discussing closely with a dozen partners or so willing to talk about what you would like to do with Revit on Cloud and to help us sort out what we can deliver as part of Forge.</p>
<p>To start the conversation, just
email <a href="mailto:jim.quanci@autodesk.com">Jim Quanci</a>
at <a href="mailto:jim.quanci@autodesk.com">jim.quanci@autodesk.com</a> the
following information about your desire for Revit on the Cloud and we'll get back with you shortly to talk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your company name.</li>
<li>What you want to do with Revit on the Cloud &ndash; 5-10 sentences would be plenty.</li>
<li>How your customers would benefit from your app/service using Revit on the Cloud.</li>
<li>Who your target customers are, e.g., Architects, Mechanical Engineers, Facility Managers, Interior Designs, or whoever.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you truly do want to see Autodesk offer Revit on the Cloud, we want and need to hear from you!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
