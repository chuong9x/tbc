REX Add-In Development and Migration #revitapi #bim #aec #3dwebcoder #adsk #RevitStructure #adsklabs


It's been a while since I talked about REX. Some old dedicated posts include
&ndash; The REX SDK
&ndash; Extensions for Revit 2012
&ndash; REX Content Generator.
More recent mentions occur in my discussion of a framing cross section analyser with and without REX and its migration to Revit 2015. Now the time has come for another look...

<p>Now the time has come for another look, prompted by the following developer query:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am currently working on an API to generate plan views with loads. The API works fine on my machine, it's not super-efficient probably; as I am not an expert about programming (limitations of structural engineers &ndash; sorry), but it does the job.</p>
<p>The project has been built based on the REX 2014 SDK.</p>
<p>When I started the project, I used my personal <!--- Visual Studio --> account, without any subscription, thus I was not entitled to use the advanced settings. This is because I didn't intend to deploy it to the entire company &ndash; however, we are now thinking of doing so.</p>
<p>I had a look at the REX SDK manual and it says that I need the subscription to use the advanced settings.</p>
<!--- Attached, a small document showing the problem I encounter, as per my understanding. -->

<p>In general, I am not entirely sure about how to finalise the job so I would be very grateful if someone could give me advice on the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upgrade the API to newer versions;</li>
<li>Create a custom ribbon palette that is automatically installed when Revit is installed on someone else's machine;</li>
<li>Make sure the add-in goes under that ribbon palette;</li>
<li>Generate an installer EXE file to distribute to the company.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Congratulations on implementing an add-in that does the job.</p>
<p>I am not familiar with the advanced settings that you mention.</p>
<!--- I also do not see 'attached small document' that you refer to. -->

<p>As far as I know, all different possible flavours of the Revit and REX APIs are identical, and there is no differentiation whatsoever between different levels of entitlement or access.</p>
<!---
Therefore, I assume that you are referring to some kind of product feature.

Can you confirm that, please, and maybe clarify exactly what you mean by 'advanced settings'?
-->

<p>I do not have anything much to suggest regarding your questions on creating an installer, either.</p>
<p>That is obviously not really related to the Revit or REX APIs.</p>
<p>I have seen various cool examples of installers in several publicly available sample applications, and mentioned some of them now and then on The Building Coder, e.g.,
for the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/07/revitrubyshell-implementation-and-installer.html">RevitRubyShell</a>.</p>
<p>One way to get official help from Autodesk with you installer is to package your add-in for the <a href="https://apps.autodesk.com">AppStore</a>.</p>
<p>If you are happy to make it available in public, that would probably be the easiest way to go, and offer lots of possible additional benefits as well.</p>
<p><strong>Answer II:</strong> This was followed up by a more in-depth answer from the development team:</p>
<p>I assume that user project was built in Visual Studio 2010 for Revit 2014 and now it's planned to have it working in Revit 2016.</p>
<p>It's possible to update your project to new version by following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Autodesk Revit 2016.</li>
<li>Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (or later).</li>
<li>Open source project, update all references to 2016 version, e.g., RevitAPI.dll, RevitAPIUI.dll, Autodesk.REX.Framework, etc.</li>
<li>Change target .NET platform version from 4.0 to 4.5.</li>
<li>Update version in settings.xml file</li>
<li>Update version in DirectRevitAccess.cs in the method <code>currentDomain_AssemblyResolve</code> replacing "2014" by <code>Autodesk.REX.Framework.REXConfiguration.Control.VersionName</code>.</li>
<li>Update version in Program.cs in similar way as point 6</li>
<li>Update source code with latest Revit API changes &ndash; the documentation file "Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx" might be helpful.</li>
<li>Addin manifest file should be placed now in Revit 2016 addins directory.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is information about advanced settings in SDK but it means that the end user needs to have the Revit Extensions (subscription only) installed.</p>
<p>If you would like to have your module working for users without Revit Extensions installed, you need to handle this yourself, for example by creating your own external application.</p>
<p>In this case you can do everything supported by the Revit API with the ribbon, e.g., create your own ribbon tab, add panels and buttons to it, etc.</p>
<p>The 'advanced settings' give the ability to integrate the module into the Revit Extension ribbon and create an installation project (Visual Studio 2010 only):</p>

</center></p>
<p>It appears that you would like to create your own ribbon.</p>
<p>Another option is create a new module with 'Support for Exchange' enabled and move all code to that:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/rex_app_2.png" alt="REX app" width="754">
</center></p>
<p>This will give the possibility to launch the Extension ribbon on computers with or without Revit Extensions with following results:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/rex_app_3.png" alt="REX app" width="710">
</center></p>
<p>The REX SDK documentation includes a description about how this can be achieved. The new module is also an external application ready to be installed in the ApplicationPlugins directory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to manage your own deployment and installation using the current Visual Studio deployment projects or some other installation system
like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis">NSIS</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck and have fun making use of the REX SDK!</p>
