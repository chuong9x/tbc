<h3>Add-In Templates Supporting Edit and Continue</h3>
<p>Last week, I presented Andrey
Bushman's <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/new-visual-studio-2015-templates-for-revit-add-ins.html">new Visual Studio templates for Revit add-ins</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we discussed many aspects
of <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.49">edit and continue</a> in
the past, including the solution to use
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/10/ai-edit-and-continue.html#2">Add-in Manager</a>.</p>
<p>These two topics have now met and united, because Andrey added support for that and a bunch of other new functionality in
his <a href="https://github.com/Andrey-Bushman/Revit2017AddInTemplateSet/commit/e1a3ceb811717929b5d758cacd41e9f46917758f">commit</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revit 2017 class library (C# project template).</li>
<li>Revit 2017 new class (C# item template).</li>
<li>The <code>Revit 2017 External Application</code> contains a special additional configuration &ndash; <code>Debug via Revit Add-In Manager</code>. It enables you to edit and debug your external command code without restarting Revit.</li>
<li>Templates of all projects include a search engine to search for missing .NET assemblies. You can use the <code>AssemblyResolves.xml</code> configuration file for managing where your missing assemblies might be located.</li>
<li>Video tutorial on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFFwG6rz0gc">Debugging using the Add-In Manager</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to

see the full context and list of other video tutorials.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Andrey for setting up and maintaining these powerful and full-fledged templates!</p>
