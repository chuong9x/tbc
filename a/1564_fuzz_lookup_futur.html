- TED talk on [The incredible inventions of intuitive AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5N2Jl8k14) by Maurice Conti, published on 28 Feb 2017, also turns to the topic of connectedness towards the end:

  fuzzy comparison
  /a/doc/revit/tbc/git/a $ grep -i fuzz *[md]
  0134_nested_instance_geo.htm:I implement this container by using a generic dictionary class and attaching an equality comparison class which ensures that almost equal points are regarded as being exactly equal, allowing for some fuzziness due to numerical imprecision.
  0134_nested_instance_geo.htm:The sorting process requires another fuzzy comparison routine, a Compare function which determines whether a given point is larger than, equal to, or smaller than another one, and correspondingly returns 1, 0 or -1.
  0620_top_faces_of_wall.htm:Obviously, like all comparisons of real numbers, that requires us to add a fuzz factor, since real-valued coordinates will almost never be exactly equal.
  0620_top_faces_of_wall.htm:<p>I already implemented an XYZ equality comparer incorporating such a fuzz factor in
  0737_melbourne_day_2.htm:For this, we need to somehow implement a fuzzy method to distinguish between points that really are different, but detect that points that are nearly the same should in fact be treated as identical.
  0791_obj_export_basics.htm:<p>As discussed so many times in the past, the point comparison has to include some fuzz.
  0918_contiguous_curves.htm:Since the built-in Revit database length unit is feet, I define the following fuzz factor for that:</p>
  1202_plane_proj_pick.htm:<p>I would recommend never doing that, because they could always be off by an infinitesimal amount, in which case the comparison would return false, even if they are almost equal, within the possible precision. You need to use fuzzy comparison for floating point numbers. Look at this discussion on
  1304_back_from_easter.htm:<p>The easiest, I find, is to implement a fuzzy point equality comparer and then add the points as keys to a dictionary.</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Connected BIM</h4>
<p>Last week, I mentioned the
momentous <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/ai-news-and-sub-transaction-regen.html#2">AI news</a> that
AlphaGo has now conclusively beaten mankind at the game of Go and is retiring from competitive play.</p>
<p>AI is not the only exciting thing happening with computers right now.</p>
<p>Much cheaper and more accessible technology with immediate and potentially revolutionary impact is provided by cheap sensors and connectedness, as explained in the Redshift article by Nicolas Mangon
on <a href="https://redshift.autodesk.com/connected-bim">the end of BIM as you know it &ndash; are you ready for connected BIM?</a></p>
<p>It discusses the combination of cheap sensors with GPS and connectivity, ending up with an outlook on AR and VR.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Intuitive AI</h4>
<p>This in turn plays well with Maurice Conti's TED talk
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR5N2Jl8k14">The incredible inventions of intuitive AI</a>,
which also turns to the topic of connectedness towards the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you get when you give a design tool a digital nervous system? Computers that improve our ability to think and imagine, and robotic systems that come up with (and build) radical new designs for bridges, cars, drones and much more &ndash; all by themselves.

<p>Back to the Revit API:</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Fuzzy Comparison</h4>
<p>A regularly asked question came up again in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/face-curve-loop-last-and-next-point/m-p/7130212">face curve loop last and next point</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I don't understand why the end point of one curve and first point of next curve are not in exactly the same place when I examine the edges from the top face of a curved wall.</p>
<p>The curve endpoint coordinates differ in the last digits. As you can see, the last three digits are 655 and 612, respectively:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/fuzz_curve_end_point_coords.png" alt="Curve endpoint digits differ" width="665">
</center></p>
<p>Due to this, I cannot get a closed curve loop. </p>
<p>Any solution or it is bug?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You need to implement a <u><b>fuzzy</b></u> comparison operator, since real-valued coordinates will almost never be exactly equal.</p>
<p>Here are a number of previous discussions of this topic:</p>
