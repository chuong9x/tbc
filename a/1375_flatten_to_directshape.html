Flatten Everything to DirectShape #revitapi #bim #aec #3dwebcoder #adsk #adskdevnetwrk #geometry #au2015 #3d #apis

I am still busy preparing my presentations for Autodesk University and making slow progress due to handling too many Revit API issues in between. And blogging, as well. Here is a new cool sample contributed by Nikolay Shulga, Senior Principal Engineer in the Revit development team. In his own words
&ndash; Name: Flatten
&ndash; Motivation: I wanted to see whether DirectShapes could be used to lock down a Revit design &ndash; remove most intelligence, make it read-only, perhaps improve performance
&ndash; Spec: converts full Revit elements into DirectShapes that hold the same shape and have the same categories
&ndash; Implementation: see below
&ndash; Cool API aspects: copy element’s geometry and use it elsewhere
&ndash; Cool ways to use it: lock down your project; make a copy of your element for presentation/export
&ndash; How it can be enhanced: the sky is the limit...

<h3>Flatten All Elements to DirectShape</h3>
<p>I am still busy preparing my presentations for Autodesk University and making slow progress due to handling too many Revit API issues in between.</p>
<p>And blogging, as well.</p>
<p>Here is a new cool sample contributed by Nikolay Shulga, Senior Principal Engineer in the Revit development team.</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: Flatten</li>
<li>Motivation: I wanted to see whether DirectShapes could be used to lock down a Revit design &ndash; remove most intelligence, make it read-only, perhaps improve performance.</li>
<li>Spec: converts full Revit elements into DirectShapes that hold the same shape and have the same categories.</li>
<li>Implementation: see below.</li>
<li>Cool API aspects: copy element’s geometry and use it elsewhere.</li>
<li>Cool ways to use it: lock down your project; make a copy of your element for presentation/export.</li>
<li>How it can be enhanced: the sky is the limit.</li>
<li>A suitable sample model: any Revit project. Note that the code changes the current project &ndash; make a backup copy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This fits in well with the growing interest in direct shapes, as you can observe by the rapidly growing number of entries in
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.50">DirectShape topic group</a>.</p>
<p>I implemented a new external
command <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdFlatten.cs">CmdFlatten</a>
in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples">The Building Coder samples</a> to
test and demonstrate this functionality.</p>
<p>Nikolay's original code was for a future release of Revit, so some backwards adaptation was necessary.</p>
<p>You can see the changes by looking at the last few GitHub commits.</p>
<p>Here is the final result for running in Revit 2016:</p>

<p>Here is a trivial example of flattening a wall to a direct shape:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/flatten_01.png" alt="Original wall element" width="242">
</center></p>
<p>This is the automatically generated DirectShape replacement element, retaining the wall category and storing its original element id:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/flatten_02.png" alt="DirectShape replacement element" width="193">
</center></p>
<p>Let's try it out on a slightly more complex model:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/flatten_03.png" alt="Walls with doors and windows" width="465">
</center></p>
<p>The family instances get lost by the conversion in its current implementation:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/flatten_04.png" alt="DirectShape replacement element" width="322">
</center></p>
<p>If you wish to retain family instances, you should probably explore their geometry in a little bit more detail, e.g., to extract all the solids they contain and convert them individually.</p>
<p>The current version is provided in the

<p>Have fun playing with this, and many thanks to Nikolay for implementing and sharing it!</p>
