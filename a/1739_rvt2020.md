### The Revit 2020 

Happy Easter!

I've been too busy in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) to
blog properly.

Here are some quick notes anyway as an Easter present for you:



#### <a name="2"></a> RevitLookup for Revit 2020

I migrated [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) to Revit 2020.

No source code changes at all were required; I just changed the Revit API DLL assembly references and updated the readme file to
create  [RevitLookup release 2020.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2020.0.0.0).

In addition, Harry Mattison of [Boost your BIM](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com) very
kindly provided a ready-built new installer in his post
on [RevitLookup for Revit 2020](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/revit-lookup-for-revit-2020), saying:

> Iâ€™ve added some conditional compilation and multiple configurations so that the single solution can be used to build against any version of Revit 2017-2020.


#### <a name="3"></a> Revit 2020 SDK posted

Last week, I described how
I [installed the Revit 2020 SDK](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html) from
the Revit 2020 installation `Setup.exe`
and [set up RvtSamples](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html#8) for it.

Now, in addition, the Revit 2020 SDK has also been posted to
the [Revit developer centre public web page](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit),
so you can access it from there independently of the Revit product installation.


#### <a name="4"></a> Generative Design with Philippe Starck

Autodesk announced a
joint [collaboration of an algorithm with star designer Philippe Starck to create the first commercial product made using generative design](https://www.fastcompany.com/90334218/this-is-the-first-commercial-product-made-using-generative-design),
a chair that will soon go on sale:

I wish you easy sailing, much fun and success setting up and exploring Revit 2020 yourself!
