<h3>RevitLookup is on GitHub and You are Invited to Collaborate</h3>

<p>I sincerely hope that everybody reading this is aware of the power and importance of RevitLookup, has already installed it, and is an avid user.</p>

<p>If you do not know what I am talking about, please read these previous posts on the topic, noting that it was previously named RvtMgdDbg, short for 'Revit managed debugging tool':</p>

hosting it on GitHub instead, to facilitate community enhancements.</p>

<p>I talked this over with the development team and now finally got around to doing it.</p>

<h4>RevitLookup GitHub Repository</h4>

<p>RevitLookup now lives in its own

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">
RevitLookup repository</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>I already integrated some enhancements for structural models provided by Thomas Fink of

<a href="http://www.sofistik.com">SOFiSTiK AG</a>.</p>

<p>I made Matt Mason a collaborator on this project and he added some generic enhancements of his own as well, with no need for me to intervene at all in any way.</p>

<p>The current version on GitHub thus already sports some improvements over the standard SDK one, so I would suggest you upgrade to that right away.
Simply clone it to your desktop, compile, and replace your existing .NET assembly DLL with the new one.</p>

<h4>Invitation to Collaborate</h4>

<p>I am happy to welcome anyone else as well who would like to collaborate on this project.</p>

<p>To begin with, however, to get to know you a little, I would suggest that you use 'Fork & Pull' approach as opposed to the 'Shared Repository' approach, so that I can see what you plan to do.</p>

<p>For details on how to go about this, please look at</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Using Pull Requests</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Before you can contribute anything at all, of course, you need to discover a problem and fix it.</p>

<p>Here are some words from an old ADN case on such an issue:</p>

<h4>Fixing RevitLookup</h4>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have used RevitLookup with Revit Architecture without any problems.</p>

<p>When I use it with Revit Structure it works as long as I do not try to snoop a rebar.</p>

<p>Is there a version of RevitLookup that can snoop rebar elements?</p>

<p>Without a software like RevitLookup it would be very time consuming to learn how to access rebar data.</p>


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can fix any problems that you encounter in RevitLookup yourself, if you like.</p>

<p>Simply run RevitLookup in the Visual Studio debugger, select the offending Revit element, and see what is causing the problem.</p>

<p>Normally, an exception is thrown, which terminates the operation.</p>

<p>If you add an exception handler around the offending line, then all the other information will still be displayed.</p>

<p>That is a cheap fix and workaround solution.</p>

<p>A better solution, of course, is to implement an improved handling of the problematic element, which is often also quite simple.</p>

<p>I haven discussed several such improvements in the past on the blog, e.g.,

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/fixing-rvtmgddbg-for-mep-connectors.html">
fixing RevitLookup for MEP connectors</a>.</p>

<p>You have the source. The power is in your hands.</p>

<p>With the new repository in place, any useful enhancements can easily be integrated into the main stream for all to share and enjoy.</p>

<p>Good luck and have fun debugging and enhancing RevitLookup together!</p>
