<h4>Revit API Developer Guide Shortcut URL</h4>

<p>The Revit API Developer Guide shortcut URL has changed and is now

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/revitapi-help">www.autodesk.com/revitapi-help</a>.</p>

<p>To my utter shock and chagrin, the previous one &ndash;

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/revitapi-wikihelp">www.autodesk.com/revitapi-wikihelp</a> &ndash;

has "expired" and no longer works.</p>

<p>Very sorry about that, out of my hands!</p>

<p>I have fixed the old blog posts using that URL:</p>
