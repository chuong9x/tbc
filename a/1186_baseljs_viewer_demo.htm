<h3>Basel.js Meetup View and Data API Demo</h3>

<p>I am busy right now answering Revit API cases as usual, and preparing my <a href="#3">Basel.js meetup View and Data API presentation</a> for tomorrow evening.</p>

<p>One of the cases caused me to add

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/07/teaching-a-man-how-to-fish-and-schedule-creation.html#3">yet another iteration</a> to

last Friday's note on how to empower yourself to

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/07/teaching-a-man-how-to-fish-and-schedule-creation.html">search for an answer</a> on the Internet.</p>

<p>Also, before I get to the technical stuff, let me mention that I went climbing again last weekend, after a long break, and in spite of the rather dubious weather situation.</p>

<p>I stayed in the

<a href="http://www.wiwanni.ch">Wiwanni hut</a> in the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valais">Canton of Valais</a> with

two friends and my son Cornelius, who returned from his studies of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine">Traditional Chinese Medicine</a> in

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>,

China, for a one-month visit in Europe.</p>

<p>We warmed up on the Salamander route to the summit of the Klein Augstkummenhorn (2880 m), then climbed the classical Steinadler route on the south face of the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwannihorn">Wiwannihorn</a> (3001 m),

scrambling down the normal route to return to the hut and back home.</p>

<p>We skipped the final two or three easier rope lengths to the summit, though, due to the uncertain weather conditions.</p>

<h4>Autodesk View and Data API Presentation</h4>

<p>I am presenting the

Autodesk View and Data API</a> at the

<a href="http://www.meetup.com/basel-js/events/192651262">Basel.js meetup</a> hosted by

<a href="http://www.magnolia-cms.com">Magnolia International</a> in

<p>It would be really great to see you there!</p>

<p>Please note that the View and Data API is still in pilot program mode, so you cannot yet apply for an API key... or rather, you can apply as much as you want, but you won't receive one quite yet.
That is coming real soon, now, though.</p>
