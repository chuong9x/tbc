<h3>Solar Radiation Technology Preview</h3>

<p>The 

<a href="http://labs.autodesk.com/utilities/ecotect">
solar radiation technology preview</a> for Revit 2011

is now available. 
It helps understand and quantify solar radiation on the surfaces of a conceptual building model.
This can help make informed design decisions about building shape, orientation, and shading strategies early on when changes are least expensive.

<p>A new version was just released, including many improvements and closer inntegrated in the Revit user interface:</p>

<p>One aspect of interest to application developers is that this plug-in is written entirely using the public Revit API, in addition to the Solar Radiation logic from Ecotect wrapped in a library that is also used from the plug-in code. 
While there is no direct API access to call the functionality programmatically, it does showcase the new Revit 2011 APIs:

<ul>
<li>Dynamic Update API
<li>Analysis Visualization Framework
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/idling-event.html">Idling Event</a>
<li>Sun Path API
</ul>

<p>We will be discussing these in greater depth anon.</p>
