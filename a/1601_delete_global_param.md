- 13580220 [Deletion of Global Parameters]

 #RevitAPI @AutodeskRevit #bim #dynamobim @AutodeskForge #ForgeDevCon 

I have list of all global parameters from the active Revit document. I want to delete a specific global parameter from the list programmatically. Kindly suggest a way to delete a global parameter from the active document...

### Deleting a Global Parameter and RevitPythonShell

This is another entry in the endless list of my attempts to teaching the developer community how to fish instead of feeding it.

This time, we address the question on how to:

- [Test the result using RevitPythonShell](#3)

####<a name="2"></a>Deleting a Global Parameter

**Question:** I have list of all global parameters from the active Revit document. I want to delete a specific global parameter from the list programmatically. Kindly suggest a way to delete a global parameter from the active document.

**Answer:** Thank you for your query.

You can easily answer this question yourself, you know.

I did not know either, on first reading your question.

Here is the path I took to search for an answer:

I initially [searched the Internet for 'revit api delete global parameter'](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=revit+api+delete+global+parameter).

This led to some non-API discussions, such as the one
by [RevitCat](http://revitcat.blogspot.de) 
on [Deleting Global Parameters in Revit](http://revitcat.blogspot.de/2017/04/deleting-global-parameters-in-revit.html).

It also led to the official [developer guide discussion on managing global parameters](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/getting-started/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/Revit-API/files/GUID-9FDC35A5-C054-46CA-B2DC-E20958FD197F-htm.html).

There, I learned that this is achieved programmatically using
the [`GlobalParametersManager` class](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/f3af05ec-1f0c-fe86-6708-0a211a40bcda.htm).

It does not provide any method to delete a global parameter.

However, the access to global parameters is provided by
the [`FindByName` method](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/7c7a7bd3-18e8-d9be-d9a7-66cd9ecdccc7.htm).

That method simply returns an element id.

This means that each global parameter is stored in the document database as a normal Revit element.

This means that it can be deleted using the `Document.Delete` method taking an `ElementId` or a collection, just like any other Revit element.

####<a name="3"></a>Testing Using RevitPythonShell

I decided to try this out on the fly
using [RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell).

I did not have it installed previously, but that can be achieved in seconds with a single click on
the [RevitPythonShell installer](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell#installation).

I then launched Revit and created a global parameter manually through the user interface:

<center>
<img src="img/global_parameter_01.png" alt="Global parameter" width="475"/>
</center>

Next, I started the interactive Python shell and ran the following code:

<pre class="prettyprint">
from Autodesk.Revit.DB import *
doc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument.Document
id = GlobalParametersManager.FindByName(doc,'Test')
t = Transaction(doc)
t.Start('delete gp')
doc.Delete(id)
t.Commit()
</pre>

Immediately after running this code, the global parameter is no longer listed in the user interface.

I trust this solves your issue.
