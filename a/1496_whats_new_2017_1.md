### What's New in the Revit 2017.1 API

I recently mentioned the
updated [Revit 2017.1 SDK](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/10/au-revit-20171-and-rex-freezedrawing.html#4) and
its API enhancements.

They are documented in full detail in the section *Major additions to the 2017.1 Revit API* of the Revit 2017.1 API help file `RevitAPI.chm` included with the SDK, which is also provided there in the separate stand-alone document *Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx*.

For convenient, easy and effective web searching, here is the online version of that information.

I am only including that specific section here.

The rest of the document contents are identical with the original information
about [What's New in the Revit 2017 API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2017-api.html) provided
with the initial release of the Revit 2017 API.

I made one small enhancement to that existing blog post as well, though:


#### <a name="2"></a>Small Addendum to What's New in the Revit 2017 API

I just [made a small modification](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/commit/b530c96b219422e9bc76eaf7698113fce4cf4968),
adding the following note to [What's New in the Revit 2017 API](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2017-api.html):

- [TextNote creation behaviour change](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2017-api.html#2.9.2)
&ndash; The various `TextNote.Create` methods now need to be followed by a call to `Document.Regenerate` before the newly created `TextNote` can be queried for data.

It was missing in the version I originally published.
I don't know when it slunk in there without me noticing.


#### <a name="3"></a>More About What's New

The *What's New* section always provides very important information, both for discovering and exploring the newly added API functionality and for later reference.

If you encounter any issues migrating your existing add-ins between different versions, this is one of the first ports of call.

Here are links to the preceding 'What's New in the API' discussions:

### <a name="4"></a>Major Additions to the 2017.1 Revit API

### <a name="4.1"></a>API enabled in perspective views

#### <a name="4.1.1"></a>Element modifications and contextual commands

Modification of many different object types is now allowed in perspective views. Most commands allowed in 3D orthographic views are now also allowed in perspective views. This includes contextual commands. Annotations are an exception and cannot be created in perspective views.

#### <a name="4.1.2"></a>External commands and applications

External API commands and applications are now enabled by default in perspective views. The following behaviour applies:

- Any external command that was automatically disabled by Revit when a perspective view is active will now be active. No code changes are necessary to make this happen.
- Any external command that was explicitly disabled in perspective views will remain disabled. For example, if your command has an accessibility function limiting it to use in certain view types, the command will not be accessible in perspective views unless that function accepts ViewType.ThreeD as a view type that is allowed.
- Macros, the Macro Manager tools, Dynamo scripts and the Dynamo editor are also newly enabled when a perspective view is active.

### <a name="4.2"></a>Geometry API additions

#### <a name="4.2.1"></a>BRepBuilder API additions

Two new methods have been added to handle problematic faces:

- BRepBuilder.AllowRemovalOfProblematicFaces() &ndash; Allows BRepBuilder to remove problematic faces (e.g., due to inaccurate edge geometry).
- BRepBuilder.RemovedSomeFaces() &ndash; Returns true if BRepBuilder removed some problematic faces from the output geometry.
One new method has been added to relax validation criteria on the input geometry:
- BRepBuilder.SetAllowShortEdges() &ndash; Makes the BRepBuilder allow edges that it would normally disallow as being too short for Revit geometry.

#### <a name="4.2.2"></a>BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry API additions

A new overload of the method:

- static BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry.CreateNURBSSurface()

constructs a BRepBuilderSurfaceGeometry based on NURBS surface data, where the weights are not supplied.

#### <a name="4.2.3"></a>Ellipse API additions

The new method:

- static Ellipse.CreateCurve()

creates a new geometric ellipse or elliptical arc object.

#### <a name="4.2.4"></a>RevolvedSurface API additions

The new method:

- RevolvedSurface.GetProfileCurveInWorldCoordinates()

returns a copy of the profile curve expressed in the world coordinate system.

allows users to customize ordinate dimensions.

The new enum:

- OrdinateDimensionLineStyle

allows users to choose continuous or segmented line styles for their dimensions.

The new enums:

- OrdinateDimensionSetting.DimLineLength
- OrdinateDimensionSetting.DimLineStyle
- OrdinateDimensionSetting.TextOrientation
- OrdinateDimensionSetting.TextPosition
- OrdinateDimensionSetting.OriginVisibility
- OrdinateDimensionSetting.OriginTickMarkId

The following new methods in DimensionType allow access to the OrdinateDimensionSetting:

### <a name="4.4"></a>FabricationPart detailing API

#### <a name="4.4.2"></a>Detailed Fabrication additions

Several methods, properties classes and enumerations have been added to allow the user to access detailed fabrication information defined in the fabrication configuration and in use on the fabrication parts.

The following methods allow access fabrication data defined by the currently loaded fabrication configuration. These can be used to query what fabrication data is available for fabrication parts to use:

- FabricationConfiguration.GetAllDampers() &ndash; Lists all damper identifiers.

#### <a name="4.4.3"></a>Ancillary usage additions

A method was added to query fabrication part ancillary usage. This method can be used to populate cut lists and procure ancillaries needed to fabricate and install the fabrication part:

- FabricationPart.GetPartAncillaryUsage() &ndash; Gets a list of FabricationAncillaryUsage structures that lists the
ancillaries that the fabrication part uses.

The ancillary usage is held in a new class:

- FabricationAncillaryUsage

It has the following read-only properties:

- FabricationAncillaryUsage.Type &ndash; A new enumerated type FabricationAncillaryType which describes what kind of ancillary it is (e.g., a fixing, airturn vane or support material).

- FabricationPart.PartGuid &ndash; Query the part's fabrication globally unique identifier, as used in applications such as Tracker.
