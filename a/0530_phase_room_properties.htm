<!-- 1266353 [Family Instance (Door/ Window) - (From / To / Room) Room Properties] -->

<h3>Phase Dependent Room Properties</h3>

<p>Here is a recent query from a developer on the family instance FromRoom and ToRoom properties. He asked:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am unable to retrieve the room associated with certain door and window instances.

<p>I attached a Revit model where the family instance room properties return "null", even though the doors are associated with a room.

<p>Why do the ToRoom and FromRoom family instance properties return "null" for these doors?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I analysed your model and see no issues with the functionality of the inconsistent property values. 
Here is the explanation:

<p>It seems that the cause of this problem is phasing. 
Your model defines three phases: existing, new construction, and optional. 
No rooms are defined in the optional phase.

<p>The FamilyInstance.FromRoom property returns the room from which the door is opened at the last phase of the project. 
I tried calling the FamilyInstance.FromRoom[Phase] method with a proper phase and it works well.

<p><strong>Response:</strong> I tried using FamilyInstance.FromRoom[Phase] as you suggested, and I am still unable to get the room. 
Can you kindly send me the sample code which you used?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please try the code snippet below.

<p>As said, your model defines the following three phases: Existing, New Construction, and Optional-in order.

<p>The rooms' phasing is "New Construction".

<p>The doors' phase created is "New Construction" and the phase demolished is "None".

<p>The result of running the following code is:

<ul>
<li>Input phase "Existing" throws an exception, because the door does not exist in the given phase.
<li>Input phase "New Construction" returns the rooms.
<li>Input phase "Optional" returns null, because no rooms are defined in this phase.
</ul>

&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> It is working and I am able to retrieve the room now.

<p>Just one more thing to be aware of... Watch your phases!
