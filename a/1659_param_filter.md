The new [Learning Forge Tutorials](http://learnforge.autodesk.io) have
been live for a few months &ndash; cf. individual launch dates below.

So far, they have been used and validated in the San Francisco, Boston, Bangalore and Munich accelerators.

It is wonderful to behold how the accelerator attendees just follow them and get a starting app up and running in days!

####<a name="3"></a>Filtering for a Specific Parameter Value

Returning to the Revit API, a frequent  task is to extract elements based on specific parameter values.

This question was raised yet again and brought up some fresh aspects in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [filtering for elements by parameter value](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/filter-elements-by-parameter-value/m-p/8035505):

**Question:** Hi, I've searched the forums for this but couldn't find a clear answer.

I'm trying to select all elements in a filtered element collector where a parameter, let's say, "house number", equals "12".

Any other solution where I'd be able to loop through or list all elements that have this parameter value are welcome too.

**Answer:** I think you can just do the following:

<pre class="code">
  var collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc)
    .Where(a => a.LookupParameter("house number")
      .AsString() == "12")
</pre>

Assuming that the storage type of your parameter is string.

**Response:** I tried using it (also checked whether the parameter was a string just to be sure), but the var `collector` end up `null`.

The message I get when looking at it in the locals is: "The collector does not have a filter applied.  Extraction or iteration of elements is not permitted without a filter."

**Answer 1:** My mistake.

The `Where` clause is actually a .NET post-processing `LINQ` statement, so the filtered element collector does not see any filter at all.

I normally always look for a specific element type when using a collector. 

This code filters for family instances first and works for me:

<pre class="code">
  List<FamilyInstance> list
    = new FilteredElementCollector(doc)
      .OfClass(typeof(FamilyInstance))
      .Where(a => a.LookupParameter("house number")
        .AsString() == "12")
      .Cast<FamilyInstance>()
      .ToList();
</pre>

It creates a list of `FamilyInstance` elements.

You can change the type to any desired one.

There are other ways to not apply a filter
and [get all element types in one go](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/filter-for-all-elements.html);
however, I would not recommend that, because you never know beforehand which kind of elements may pass the filter if you do.

**Answer 2:** The first answer uses post-processing in .NET.

That means that the initial filtering takes place in Revit; then, all family instances are transferred to .NET to check the parameter value.

That causes a huge overhead.

The overhead can be eliminated by using a parameter filter instead, that checks for the parameter value directly in Revit, before transferring any data to .NET.

If you don't care, the first solution is fine, of course.

Here are some examples of using parameter filters:

- [Parameter filter](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/parameter-filter.html)
- [Element name parameter filter correction](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/element-name-parameter-filter-correction.html)
- [Parameter filter units](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/parameter-filter-units.html)
- [Finding all possible `ElementId` values for a specific parameter](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/finding-an-exit-path-and-elementid-parameter-values.html#3)

####<a name="4"></a>Filtered Element Collector Optimisation

**Response:** Hmmm...

Now I'm in doubt about whether or not I should rewrite the collectors in all my own add-ins to remove that overhead myself...

Some commands that take a long time might actually benefit from that if it's a big difference.

Most commands are nearly instant, though, so I don't think it would matter in that case.

Thanks for the insight Jeremy, as always, very helpful! &nbsp; :-)

**Answer:** Thank you for your appreciation and very glad to hear you find it useful.

Years ago, [I benchmarked different filtered element collectors](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/collector-benchmark.html) and
found that moving from .NET post-processing to a parameter filter will save at least 50% overhead.

In a large model, it might be more.

Benchmark first, before you do anything!

If it works, don't fix it.

Also, the most important thing to start with is to always be aware of the differences between quick and slow filters, and post-processing in .NET,
cf. [Quick, Slow and LINQ Element Filtering](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/12/quick-slow-and-linq-element-filtering.html).

To start with, apply as many filter shortcuts to the filtered element collector as you can.
All filter shortcuts are quick filters.
They are provided by methods that are available directly 
as [`FilteredElementCollector` member methods](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018/163d1fae-e9d8-e4de-7452-c3b140b6daad.htm).
