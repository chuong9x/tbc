<h3>Implement Progress Bar and Abort Lengthy Process</h3>

<p>The time has come to talk of many things: of shoes and ships, and sealing-wax, of cabbages and kings
[<a href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html">^</a>]...
or no, let's continue sticking to the Revit API for now, more or less;
today's topics are:

<h4>A Walk in the Snow</h4>

<p>I went for a walk in snow and fog on a local hill and appreciated this wind-driven ice crystal covered baby tree that:</p>

<p>I thought I would like to share that with you.
Sorry that it is so dark, but that's the way it was.</p>

<h4>Implementing a Revit Add-in Progress Bar</h4>

<p>I chatted with Harry Mattison on various topics during the winter break.
One of them was the implementation of a Revit add-in progress bar:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am trying to make a simple progress dialog based on your post on

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/revit-window-handle-and-modeless-dialogues.html">modeless dialogues</a>.

It seems to work well basically but has a few problems:

<ol>
<li>The first time I run the command, the progress dialog flashes briefly on the screen and then disappears.
<li>The text label does not display properly.
<li>Sometimes the entire progress dialogue content turns white and the title bar says 'Not Responding'.
</ol>

<p>Could you help me figure out if my approach is flawed or if it just needs some small adjustments?


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Thank you, but no thank you...  :-)

<p>Instead, I propose that you look at my existing modeless progress bar implementation in the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html">
ADN Revit MEP sample add-in</a>,

which has worked flawlessly for years now.


<p><strong>Response:</strong> Your progress bar is great!
I wish I had found it earlier.

<h4>Aborting a Lengthy Process</h4>

<p>Here's hopefully one last question about the progress bar:

<p>How can the user cancel the operation from the progress bar?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You could implement some standard .NET stuff on the progress bar; maybe simply add a cancel button to it, and an event handler for that.

<p><strong>Response:</strong> After spending some time thinking about events and the like, I realized the progress bar cancel solution is almost trivial.

<p>An idle event wouldn't work in my case, because Revit was never going idle.
It was too busy doing hard work of exporting images for my <a href="http://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/products">Image-O-Matic</a> application.
Instead, all I needed to do is add the Abort button to the progress dialog, and put this little bit of code in the progress bar class:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">private</span> <span class="blue">void</span> btnAbort_Click(
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">object</span> sender,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">EventArgs</span> e )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; btnAbort.Text = <span class="maroon">&quot;Aborting...&quot;</span>;
&nbsp; &nbsp; abortFlag = <span class="blue">true</span>;
&nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">bool</span> getAbortFlag()
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> abortFlag;
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>Then, inside my foreach loops, I just need to check the status of the flag:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">foreach</span>( <span class="blue">string</span> phaseName <span class="blue">in</span> phaseList )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( progressForm.getAbortFlag() )
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">break</span>;
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">// . . .</span>
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>Many thanks to Harry for the fruitful discussion and helpful hint!</p>

<h4>Image Generation Video Competition</h4>

<p>Yet another item from Harry, this time a rather shameless plug, but I guess he earned it  :-)</p>
