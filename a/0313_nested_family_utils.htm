<h3>Nested Family Utility Methods</h3>

<p>Nested families seem to be a recurring topic right now.
We just recently discussed how to test whether a family instance in a project file is 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/02/nested-family-instance.html">
nested inside another</a>,

and before that we addressed

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/nested-instance-geometry.html">
nested instance geometry</a> and 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/nested-family.html">
creating a nested family</a>.

The first place to look for information on using the Revit API in the context of families is the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-revit-family-api.html">
overview of the family API</a>

with the associated 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-revit-family-api.html#4">
labs</a> and the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/the-revit-family-api.html#5">
materials and recording</a> of the webcast we presented on the topic.

<p>I received a couple of useful helper methods for exploring and working in the family context from an anonymous contributor whom we can call SOA-boy, since he already contributed some hints on using 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/serviceoriented-architecture.html">
Service-Oriented Architecture</a>. Here is his description:

<p>Because the normal filtering mechanism apparently doesn't work for detecting nested family definitions or nested family instances within a family document, I wrote some code for iterating over all the elements in the host family document as quickly as possible. 
The code is intended to be highly reusable. 

<p>Another issue addressed is to get to a nested family's parameter, because you have to call different methods depending on whether or not that parameter is a shared parameter or a family one.
The code to do that turns out to be simple, just non-intuitive, until you think about it some more.  
Maybe that's a more familiar approach to programmers of the project editor API, but if you work more in the family editor API, it wasn't intuitive at all.
Methods are provided for getting a reference to a nested family's parameter, and to allow you to link a nested family's parameter to a FamilyParameter on the host family.

<p>I implemented a new Building Coder sample module CmdNestedFamilies.cs which includes these methods in the class NestedFamilyFunctions. 
The methods provided include:

<ul>
<li>GetFilteredNestedFamilyDefinitions: 
     Returns a list of the nested family files in the given family document whose name 
     matches the given family file name filter.  Useful for checking to see if a family
     desired for nesting into the host family document is already nested in.
<li>GetFilteredNestedFamilyInstances:
     Returns a list of family instances found in the given family document whose family file
     name matches the given familyFileNameFilter and whose type name matches the given 
     typeNameFilter.  If no filter values are provided (or they evaluate to the empty string
     when trimmed) then all instances will be evaluated.
<li>GetFamilyParameter:
     Returns a reference to the FAMILY parameter (as a simple Parameter data type) on the given instance
     for the parameter with the given name.  Will return the parameter
     whether it is an instance or type parameter.
<li>LinkNestedFamilyParameterToHostFamilyParameter:
     This method takes an instance of a nested family and links a parameter on it to
     a parameter on the given host family instance.  This allows a change at the host
     level to automatically be sent down and applied to the nested family instance.
</ul>

<p>The motivation for the first method is that standard Revit filtering techniques fail when searching for nested families in a family document, so we have no choice but to iterate over all elements in the family.
While there usually aren't that many elements at the family level, nonetheless this method has been built for speed.
It returns collection of family file definitions nested into the given family document.

<p>The methods are packaged in a utility class NestedFamilyFunctions.
It also includes two helper methods FilterMatches and ValidateFamilyDocument:

<ul>
<li>FilterMatches:
     Returns whether or not the nameToCheck matches the given filter.
     This is done with a simple Contains check, so wildcards won't work.
<li>ValidateFamilyDocument:
     This method will validate the provided Revit Document to make sure the reference 
     exists and is for a FAMILY document.  It will throw an ArgumentNullException
     if nothing is sent, and will throw an ArgumentOutOfRangeException if the document
     provided isn't a family document (e.g. is a project document)
</ul>

<p>Here is the NestedFamilyFunctions source code, including some comments describing what is going on and why.
Following good SOA practices, the methods verify that the incoming data can be worked with.
