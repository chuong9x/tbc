### Freeing Your BIM Data and Roomedit3d Forge OAuth

The [Forge DevCon](http://forge.autodesk.com/conference) took off yesterday with a big bang, as you have certainly heard by now.

The [3D Web Fest](http://www.3dwebfest.com) evening event was also very cool.
My favourite was [Particle Love](http://edankwan.com/experiments/particle-love)

Today is the big day for me, with my presentation
on [Freeing your BIM Data](http://forge.autodesk.com/tracks-and-speakers/#track-4) coming up this afternoon.
