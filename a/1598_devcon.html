<h3>Forge DevCon in Las Vegas</h3>
<p>My plans changed. For the first time since 2005, I will not be visiting Las Vegas this year after all.</p>
<p>The most important participants in the Revit API session that I was preparing to host are the members of the Revit development team, anyway.</p>
<p>I very strongly urge you to not miss the chance to attend both AU and the preceding Forge developer conference, though, for all the reasons already pointed out in the article
on the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/09/forge-devcon-at-au-in-darmstadt-and-las-vegas.html">Forge DevCon at AU in Darmstadt and Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the latest news to provide that final kick, plus a very few pictures I took during the Forge accelerator last week in Lyon, France:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">Dawn in Lyon</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Forge DevCon highlights and reasons to join your peers</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Sneak peek at the Forge DevCon keynotes</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Visit the exclusive Forge DevCon village on Monday</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Get one on one with Amazon Web Services</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Decide now</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="1"></a>Dawn in Lyon</h4>
<p>Before diving into the current news on the Forge DevCon, here are a handful of <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHskqqGu2C">pictures of dawn from the hotel window and the train station of Part Dieu in Lyon</a>:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Forge DevCon Highlights and Reasons to Join your Peers</h4>
<p><em>Join over a thousand developers already working with the Forge platform and committed to accelerating their businesses and careers.</em></p>
<p>You won’t want to miss the last opportunity this year to get started with or delve deeper into Forge. </p>
<p>Hundreds of new developers are now engaging with Forge after the recent Forge DevCon conferences in China, Japan, Germany and most recently AU Russia.</p>
<p>Don’t get left behind.</p>
<p>There won’t be another opportunity like this until late 2018.</p>

<p>Customers are embracing the cloud and they need applications and services to extend their Autodesk solutions. But don’t just take our word for it.  You’ll find the cloud everywhere at AU this year. In fact, searching the class catalogue the word 'cloud' produces 168 results: </p>
