- Get Revit Camera FOV
  Many people have asked how you can retrieve the Revit camera field of view or FOV.
  As Valerii Nozdrenkov points out in
  his [comment](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/revit-camera-settings-project-plasma-da4r-and-ai.html#comment-4891620499)
  on [mapping the Revit camera settings to the Forge viewer](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/revit-camera-settings-project-plasma-da4r-and-ai.html),
  The Building Coder already published a solution suggested by Arno&scaron;t L&ouml;bel reading the required data from
  the [custom exporter `GetCameraInfo`](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/custom-exporter-getcamerainfo.html):
  > When a view is processed and run through a custom exporter context, its properties are used to populate a `ViewNode` instance.
  > One of its methods is `GetCameraInfo`, which provides information that ought to cover everything you need to know about the view's camera.

<h3>Revit Camera FOV, Forge Partner Talks and Jobs</h3>

<h4><a name="2"></a> Determining the Revit Camera FOV</h4>
<p>Many people have asked how you can retrieve the Revit camera field of view or FOV.</p>
<p>As Valerii Nozdrenkov points out in
his <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/revit-camera-settings-project-plasma-da4r-and-ai.html#comment-4891620499">comment</a>
on <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/revit-camera-settings-project-plasma-da4r-and-ai.html">mapping the Revit camera settings to the Forge viewer</a>,
The Building Coder already published a solution suggested by Arno&scaron;t L&ouml;bel reading the required data from
the <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/custom-exporter-getcamerainfo.html">custom exporter <code>GetCameraInfo</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a view is processed and run through a custom exporter context, its properties are used to populate a <code>ViewNode</code> instance.</p>
<p>One of its methods is <code>GetCameraInfo</code>, which provides information that ought to cover everything you need to know about the view's camera.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code">
  public RenderNodeAction OnViewBegin(ViewNode node)
  {
    CameraInfo cameraInfo = node.GetCameraInfo();

    var view = document.GetElement(node.ViewId);
    return RenderNodeAction.Proceed;
  }
</pre>

<p>It seems worthwhile to reiterate this, since the question keeps popping up...</p>

At distances approaching infinity, the light rays are nearly parallel to each other, resulting in a 'flattened' image. At low distances and high angles of view objects appear 'foreshortened'.</p>
