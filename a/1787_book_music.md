  This article is intended to be a starter kit for programming. You’ll find lots of links throughout to help you along your way. I know this may be coming to you in a printed format, I like it printed myself, but for what we are trying to do here, I’d recommend looking up this article on AUGI’s website so the hyperlinks will work.

- I just finished reading *Machines like me and People like you* by Ian McEwan
  A very deep and loving analysis and pondering on human intelligence, emotions and failings versus AI and machines.
  A quote towards the end of the book:
  hope you'll listen to... to one last seventeen-syllable poem... it's not about leaves and trees.
  It's about machines like me and people like you and our future together... the sadness that's to come.
  It will happen. With improvements over time... we'll surpass you... and outlive you... even as we love you.
  Believe me, these lines express no triumph... Only regret...
  Our leaves are falling.
  Come spring we will renew.
  But you, alas, fall once.

- Might you be interested in an 80-second recording of an old man playing bottleneck blues on a steel string guitar?
  Check out Andy Milburn's [What Can I Say](https://youtu.be/QrI3hvv-_Ws):
Decided to just take clips of whatever I'm messing about with and post them. Like a diary almost. Learning from my blog perhaps. Thinking out loud.

### Books and Music

I would like to share a couple of quick notes on books and music to end this week.

Simple Revit API related books, a complex AI-related one, and a quick bottleneck steel guitar blues recording not related with any technical topic whatsoever:
