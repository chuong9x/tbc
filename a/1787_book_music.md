  This article is intended to be a starter kit for programming. You’ll find lots of links throughout to help you along your way. I know this may be coming to you in a printed format, I like it printed myself, but for what we are trying to do here, I’d recommend looking up this article on AUGI’s website so the hyperlinks will work.

- I just finished reading *Machines like me and People like you* by Ian McEwan
  A very deep and loving analysis and pondering on human intelligence, emotions and failings versus AI and machines.
  A quote towards the end of the book:
  hope you'll listen to... to one last seventeen-syllable poem... it's not about leaves and trees.
  It's about machines like me and people like you and our future together... the sadness that's to come.
  It will happen. With improvements over time... we'll surpass you... and outlive you... even as we love you.
  Believe me, these lines express no triumph... Only regret...
  Our leaves are falling.
  Come spring we will renew.
  But you, alas, fall once.

- Might you be interested in an 80-second recording of an old man playing bottleneck blues on a steel string guitar?
  Check out Andy Milburn's [What Can I Say](https://youtu.be/QrI3hvv-_Ws):
Decided to just take clips of whatever I'm messing about with and post them. Like a diary almost. Learning from my blog perhaps. Thinking out loud.

### Books and Music

I would like to share a couple of quick notes on books and music to end this week.

Simple Revit API related books, a complex AI-related one, and a quick bottleneck steel guitar blues recording not related with any technical topic whatsoever:




####<a name="2"></a> A Very Basic Book on Revit API

Mehsan is [looking for a very basic book on Revit API](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/i-am-looking-for-a-very-basic-book-for-revit-2019-or-2018-api/m-p/9063954):

**Question:** I am looking for a very basic book for Revit 2019 or 2018 API.

I know CAD API but now I am looking for a very basic book for Revit 2019 or 2018 API programming.

**Answer:** I am not aware of any such book, but you can check out good tutorials on youtube by Danny Bentley and another paid tutorial by Jeremy Graham.

To get started with the Revit API, I suggest that you first take a look at the step-by-step instructions provided
by [My First Revit Plugin](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/simplecontent/content/my-first-revit-plug-overview.html).

The API documentation is provided in the *RevitAPI.chm* help file in the Revit SDK and also available online at  [revitapidocs](https://www.revitapidocs.com).

For more information, you an work through the [Revit API getting started material](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2).

Finally, some very good advice on getting started programming Revit is provided
by [David Raynor's Revit API Starter Kit described below](#3).

####<a name="3"></a> Revit API Starter Kit

David Raynor, Application Specialist and BIM Manager at Dewberry, provides some very good advice on getting started programming Revit in
his article in the [AUGIWorld October 2019 issue](https://issuu.com/augi/docs/aw201910hr) starting at
page 20: [Revit API Starter Kit](https://issuu.com/augi/docs/aw201910hr/20).

####<a name="3"></a> Machines Like Me

I just finished reading *Machines like me and People like you* by Ian McEwan.

A very deep and loving analysis and pondering on human intelligence, emotions and failings versus AI and machines, and possible future aspects we face in their interaction.

McEwan also takes a great number of very entertaining liberties with history and historical persons, e.g., Alan Turing, Margaret Thatcher, the Falkland war, AlphaGo, and dozens if not hundreds of other events.

This quote towards the end of the book sums up some of it:

> hope you'll listen to... to one last seventeen-syllable poem... it's not about leaves and trees.
It's about machines like me and people like you and our future together... the sadness that's to come.
It will happen. With improvements over time... we'll surpass you... and outlive you... even as we love you.
Believe me, these lines express no triumph... Only regret...
