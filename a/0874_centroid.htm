<h3>Solid Centroid and Volume Calculation</h3>

<p>I have not posted anything since last Friday, being too caught up in the West European Developer days and travelling.
Today and tomorrow we spend in Gothenburg on the last lap of our journey, after Paris, Milano, Farnborough and Munich.
I had a nap in the taxis to and from the airport yesterday, both in Germany and Sweden, so I was able to burn some midnight oil to share the following exploration with you.</p>

<p>One of the many interesting conversations I had at Autodesk University that caught my special attention dealt with a simple geometrical Revit API question; geometrical questions are among my favourites, and this one is really basic: how to calculate the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">
centre of mass</a> or

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid">
centroid</a> of a solid.</p>

<p>Once again, that led to the exploration of a number of interesting little sub-topics:</p>

<p>Before getting into that, here is a quick heads-up to point out a new free technology preview to simulate airflow around buildings or other objects in a virtual wind tunnel:</p>

<p>Emile Kfouri describes the

<a href="http://autodesk.typepad.com/bpa/2012/12/cfd-integrated-into-revit.html">
use and advantages of Falcon</a> in

some depth on his

<a href="http://autodesk.typepad.com/bpa">
Building Performance Analysis</a> blog

that I was previously unaware of.
He includes detailed explanations of the kind of problems this software addresses, getting started, and comparisons with other technologies such as the wind tunnel feature in

<a href="http://autodeskvasari.com">Project Vasari</a> and

<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=17141897&amp;siteID=123112">Simulation CFD 360</a>.
Fascinating stuff.

<p>By the way, this is extremely interesting to look at for any Revit add-in developer, even if you do not care about this specific kind of analysis, because it shows an impressive example of using Revit as a front-end input tool to a powerful analysis component, reporting the results back graphically using the analysis visualisation framework AVF. If you hook up these components intelligently, a lot of functionality can be achieved with little effort.

<h4>Centroid and Volume of a Solid</h4>

<p>Returning to the centroid and volume calculation, the Revit API provides both of these through the Solid ComputeCentroid method and Volume property.
As said, a conversation prompted me to explore how to implement these calculations on my own as well.

<p>Calculating exact results for an arbitrary solid is not trivial, of course, and could currently only be achieved making use of an external library.</p>

<p>If high precision is not paramount, however, we can simplify the solid to a planar faceted representation by triangulating all its faces to create a

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron">
polyhedral</a> approximation of it.

<p>Determining the centroid of a polyhedron is something that can be achieved in a very few lines of code, as I will show below.</p>


<a name="2"></a>

<h4>Gap Free Triangulation for Polyhedral Approximation</h4>

<p>Happily, the Revit 2013 API provides a method for triangulating the entire surface of a solid in one single call, ensuring a closed volume, unlike doing it face by face, which does not.</p>

<p>The Face.Triangulate method returns a triangular mesh approximation to the face.
Revit defines the approximation tolerance internally.
Calling it separately for neighbouring faces, however, will return independent triangulations that do not line up where the faces meet, leaving

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/birthdays-and-gaps-in-shells.html">
gaps in the shell</a> of

the original solid.</p>

<p>This deficiency was eliminated by the SolidUtils class introduced in Revit 2013, which provides the

TessellateSolidOrShell method to facet an entire solid or open shell in one single call.
This enables each boundary component of the solid or shell to be represented by a single properly closed triangulated structure.

<h4>Polyhedron Centroid Calculation Algorithm</h4>

<p>With these necessary and powerful basics in place, I searched the Internet for a bit of help on implementing an algorithm to calculate the centroid, and found a discussion on determining the

<a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=397122">
centre of mass of a 3D model</a> from

the

<a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com">
Game Maker Community</a>.

Here is my edited version summarising the results of that thread:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I'm working on a model editor and I have a set centre function to reset the centre of a model. I can do this a few ways which I have implemented.

<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Add vertices, average them and move the model; pseudocode:

<pre>
  for each point
    dx += point.x
    dy += point.y
    dz += point.z
    count ++

  dx/=count
  dy/=count
  dz/=count

  for each point
    point.x-=dx
    point.y-=dy
    point.z-=dz
</pre>

<p>The problem: If the model has many points in one area, the deviation favours that area.
Which is not always good because some models have many, many points like at the tip of a gun or the cone of a ship.

<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Find min max of vertices, average the min max into a deviation and move the model:

<pre>
  for each point
    mindx = min( point.x, mindx )
    maxdx = max( point.x, maxdx )
    same for y and z

  dx = (mindx + maxdx) / 2
  same for dy, dz;

  for each point
    point.x -= dx
    same for y and z
</pre>

<p>That works OK.

<p>For my third method, I would really like to centre the model on its estimated centre mass.

<p>I have a series of 3 points defining the planes/faces.
I figure I could plug either the plane area or perimeter into the deviation calculation.
That way many points defining a tiny area would not affect the calculation that much.
But I can't figure out the right math for this.

<p>Can you determine the surface areas of each face?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Well, one would assume that we'd want to count the inside of the model into the mass calculation as well, in which case you want to find the volume of the model.
This actually isn't too difficult to compute assuming that the model is closed (no holes; otherwise it wouldn't really have a well-defined volume) and that it's simple (in the mathematical sense; that means it doesn't intersect with itself).
Each triangular face contributes a tetrahedron's worth of volume to the whole model.
To find this volume given the three vertices of the face v1, v2, and v3, you need only compute v1 &middot; (v2 &times; v3 ) / 6.

<p>The following is very important.
The vertices of every face must be oriented the same way.
This means that if you look at a face from the outside of a model, its vertices should be oriented in a clockwise fashion (counter-clockwise is valid too, as long as you're consistent).

<p>So, now we essentially have a way to compute a weighting factor for every face in the model. The coordinates we have to weight this by are the centroids of each tetrahedron, given by (v1 + v2 + v3)/4.
This is because one of the vertices of every tetrahedron is the origin so it's 0, so there's no reason to include it here.
So, the centroid of the model is given by the following:

<p>&sum; (v1 + v2 + v3)/4 [v1 &middot; (v2 &times; v3 )] / &sum; [v1 &middot; (v2 &times; v3)]

<p>The sum is performed over each face.

<p>Also, the factor of 6 in the volume is left out because it cancels out because of the division.
So, loop over each face, compute the volume contribution and add that onto a total volume counter and also multiply it by that average position (you can move the division by 4 outside of the sum to make the loop faster; that way only one division needs to be performed instead of one for each face) of the tetrahedron (i.e. multiply it by the sum of the vertices).
Then, outside of the loop, divide by the total volume times 4 (assuming you moved that division by 4 outside of the loop).
You now have the centroid assuming constant density.

<p>The variables are all vectors.
The product of the three vectors is a triple scalar product.
It's the dot product with the cross product (and also the determinant of the matrix of these vectors).
It's equal to this, which can be used as a formula for the volume:

<pre>
  x1*(y2*z3 - y3*z2)
  + y1*(z2*x3 - z3*x2)
  + z1*(x2*y3 - x3*y2)
</pre>

<p>This is because one of the vertices of every tetrahedron is the origin.

<p>Note that this does not require the model to be convex.
All the tetrahedrons are not necessarily entirely contained inside the model.

<p>I only assume that the model is closed and simple.
Any tetrahedrons outside the model will have their area computed to be negative.
They'll subtract off their contributions.
The origin of the system can be anywhere as well.
It doesn't have to be inside the model.

<p>Here is the entire pseudo-code:

<pre>
  var cx, cy, cz, volume, v, i, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3;
  volume = 0;
  cx = 0; cy = 0; cz = 0;
  // Assuming vertices are in vertX[i], vertY[i], and vertZ[i]
  // and faces are faces[i, j] where the first index indicates the
  // face and the second index indicates the vertex of that face
  // The value in the faces array is an index into the vertex array
  i = 0;
  repeat (numFaces) {
    x1 = vertX[faces[i, 0]]; y1 = vertY[faces[i, 0]]; z1 = vertZ[faces[i, 0]];
    x2 = vertX[faces[i, 1]]; y2 = vertY[faces[i, 1]]; z2 = vertZ[faces[i, 1]];
    x3 = vertX[faces[i, 2]]; y3 = vertY[faces[i, 2]]; z3 = vertZ[faces[i, 2]];
    v = x1*(y2*z3 - y3*z2) + y1*(z2*x3 - z3*x2) + z1*(x2*y3 - x3*y2);
    volume += v;
    cx += (x1 + x2 + x3)*v;
    cy += (y1 + y2 + y3)*v;
    cz += (z1 + z2 + z3)*v;
    i += 1;
  }
  // Set centroid coordinates to their final value
  cx /= 4 * volume;
  cy /= 4 * volume;
  cz /= 4 * volume;
  // And, just in case you want to know the total volume of the model:
  volume /= 6;
</pre>

<p>Remember that the vertices of each face must be oriented in the same way (one way to see if they are is to turn on back face culling; if the model appears normally then they're all oriented properly--the model could also appear inside-out which would also be a valid orientation).

<p>Part of this is actually calculating the area of each triangle without having to figure out the angles, simply using the 3 side lengths.

<p>One way to achieve this is using Heron's Formula:

<pre>
  A = sqrt( s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c) )
</pre>

<p>Here a, b, c are the lengths of each side and s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c) / 2.</p>

<p>You can also just take the magnitude of the cross product of two edge vectors of the face and divide it by 2.
This means that you can find the area of a face as a side effect of determining its normal vector, just as I do in my

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/12/2d-polygon-areas-and-outer-loop.html">
GetSignedPolygonArea</a> method.

<h4>Revit Implementation and CentroidVolume Class</h4>

<p>I used the algorithm described above to implement a volume and centre of mass calculation for a Revit solid.</p>

<p>As said, curved solids are approximated by triangulating them.
The result is pretty precise for solids that are planar faceted to start with.</p>

<p>The code includes an assertion to ensure that the volume calculated as a side effect is not too far removed from the value provided by the Solid.Volume property.</p>

<p>Since the algorithm above calculates both the centroid and volume, I implemented the following little helper class to package the two together:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">class</span> <span class="teal">CentroidVolume</span>
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> CentroidVolume()
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="teal">XYZ</span> Centroid { <span class="blue">get</span>; <span class="blue">set</span>; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">double</span> Volume { <span class="blue">get</span>; <span class="blue">set</span>; }
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">override</span> <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">string</span> ToString()
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">return</span> RealString( Volume ) + <span class="maroon">&quot;@&quot;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + PointString( Centroid );
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<h4>Polyhedron Centroid Calculation Implementation</h4>

<p>My translation of the algorithm described above to Revit API looks like this, including the validation assertions at the end and an exception handler around the call to TessellateSolidOrShell for reasons explained below:</p>

<h4>Support for Multiple Solids</h4>

<p>Since the centroid of any given element will be determined by all of its solids, which may be multiple, I implemented the following GetCentroid method to determine all solids belonging to a given element and calculate its total centroid and volume across all its component solids:</p>

<h4>Mainline with Picking Twists</h4>

<p>Finally, here is the external command Execute method implementation driving this and including some additional useful picking interaction handling twists, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for pre-selection or interactive picking.</li>
<li>Checking for a valid active view type before prompting the user to pick an element.</li>
<li>Exception handling to gracefully terminate picking and the entire command on cancels.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>I ran this on the basic sample model delivered with Revit, rac_basic_sample_project.rvt, simply selecting all elements on level 1.
Not surprisingly, this causes a couple of hiccups, notably a few assertions stating that my volume approximation does not match Revit's and an exception thrown by the TessellateSolidOrShell method, in spite of calling IsValidForTessellation beforehand to ensure tht I only feed in acceptable solids to it.
This exception is caused by the teapot in the model, which is in fact a rather abnormal building element, but still...</p>

<p>These hiccups can be ironed out.
Here is the report logged to the debug output window with the hiccups and exception messages manually edited away, informing us that a large number of elements in the model are correctly processed and that for all of them my calculated approximate values correspond more or less to the ones reported by the built-in Revit API methods;
copy and paste to an editor to see the truncated lines in full:</p>
