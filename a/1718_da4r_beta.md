### Design Automation for Revit in Public Beta

The long-awaited public beta phase for Design Automation for Revit (aka Revit IO and DA4R) has finally arrived!

[The public beta is here](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/design-automation-revit-public-beta-here) today.

Design Automation for Revit makes the power of the Revit API available as a Forge-based service.

Using Design Automation for Revit, you can create, edit, and extract data from Revit models without a local Revit install. Because Design Automation is a cloud service, you can use it to create cloud-native applications that work with Revit data. Examples of ways you can use this API include: creating models automatically by entering parameters, validating specified designâ€¯criteria and generating reports, and automatically modifying the model. It is also possible to extract model data not accessible with the Forge Model Derivative API.

For a high-level introduction, watch the [AU class recording](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Data-Forge-How-Can-Design-Automation-Revit-API-Help-Me-2018).

Our previous discussion of [Design Automation for Revit at AU and in public](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/forge-design-automation-for-revit-at-au-and-in-public.html) highlights
both that class, FDC226894, by the Autodesk Revit API development team, and another, AS226079, on managing Revit digital content using DA4R, by external alpha phase developers.

The official [Forge Design Automation documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview) has
been updated to include the new Revit functionality.

It includes a [tutorial providing a good starting point to understand how DA4R works](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit).

We also encourage you to join the [DA4R beta forum](https://beta.autodesk.com/key/Forge_Design_Automation_API_Revit) to
see announcements and connect with the development team as well as other partners & customers.

More tools and samples to help you get started with DA4R are in the works. Stay tuned...
