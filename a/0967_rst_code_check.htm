<h3>Structural Analytical Code Checking and Results Builder</h3>

<p>In case you have not noticed, I would like to point out one important specialised addition to the Revit 2014 SDK: the new Structural Analysis Software Developer Kit.</p>

<p>It lives in its own sub-directory <i>Structural Analysis SDK</i> and consists of documentation, sample code and Visual Studio templates for two main components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code checking framework</li>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate code checking workflows</li>
<li>For both users and developers</li>
<li>Complete extensible add-in</li>
<li>User interface, report generator, data storage</li>
<li>Documentation, samples, Visual Studio templates</li>
</ul>
<li>Results builder framework</li>
<ul>
<li>Store and access results data in Revit</li>
<li>High-level API for consumption, exchange, remote providers</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Here is an overview of the sample applications provided with this toolkit:</p>

<ul>
<li>ExtensibleStorageUI and ExtensibleStorageDocumentation &ndash; exercise the ExtensibleStorage framework user interface and reporting functionality.</li>
<li>CodeCheckingConcreteExample &ndash; a concrete code checking application with step-by-step document.</li>
<li>ConcreteCalculationsExample &ndash; concrete calculations component for all cases listed in the calculation manual.</li>
<li>SectionPropertiesExplorer &ndash; demonstrate use the engineering component.</li>
<li>StoringResults and QueryingResults &ndash; store and query structural analysis results stored in BIM using the results builder component.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are active in this area, this provides a big lump of functionality you definitely need to be aware of, similarly to the

REX SDK</a> and content generator.</p>

<p>In a related vein, here is a question that just arose today:</p>


<a name="2"></a>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I would like to start working programmatically with Autodesk Robot to read relevant data result from structural elements such as beam, column, foundations, slab etc.</p>

<p>Where can I find some information about that, please?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please take a look at the discussion of the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/optimisation-using-robot-structural-analysis-api.html">
Robot Structural Analysis API</a>.

<p>Good luck!</p>

Note that this information is pretty dated by now, so I would not recommend putting in any significant effort developing new projects based on this today.
