### Women Coders, Forge and Revit API Docs Updates

More updates on Revit 2017, Revit 2018, and above all our treasured Revit API Docs.

If your existing app uses the obsolete View and Data API or unscoped tokens, it will stop working soon!

Finally, a note on female coders and the Twitter *Women Who Code* conference:

#### <a name="2"></a>Revit 2018 Added to Revit API Docs

[Revit API Docs](http://www.revitapidocs.com) provides online access to the full contents of the Revit API help file *RevitAPI.chm* for all versions of the Revit API from Revit 2015 onwards.

Now it is up and running with [support added for Revit 2018 as well](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018/news):

Many thanks to [Gui Talarico](http://gtalarico.com) for maintaining this invaluable resource!

Awesome, awesomely effective and awesomely simple web site, btw  :-)


#### <a name="3"></a>Revit 2018.0.1 Hot Fix

2018 has received its first little update, the Revit 2018.0.1 Hot Fix.

The reported issues resolved in Revit 2018 build 20170421_2315 include:

- Improved stability when using the pick line tool.
- Improved data integrity of the local project files after download operation when using [Collaboration for Revit C4R](http://www.autodesk.com/products/collaboration-for-revit/overview).

Here are direct links:

- [Download](http://up.autodesk.com/2018/RVT/Autodesk_Revit_2018_0_1.exe)
- [Release notes](http://revit.downloads.autodesk.com/download/2018_0_1_RVT/Docs/RelNotes/Autodesk_Revit_2018_0_1_ReleaseNotes.html)
- [Readme](http://up.autodesk.com/2018/RVT/Autodesk_Revit_2018_0_1_Readme.htm)


#### <a name="4"></a>Revit 2017.2.1 Update

A new update for Revit 2017 has been published as well, with too many enhancements to list here.

Please refer to the [release notes](http://revit.downloads.autodesk.com/download/2017_2_1_RVT/Docs/RelNotes/Autodesk_Revit_2017_2_1_ReleaseNotes.html) for full details.

Here is the [direct link to download](http://up.autodesk.com/2017/RVT/Autodesk_Revit_2017_2_1.exe) and
the [readme doc](http://up.autodesk.com/2017/RVT/Autodesk_Revit_2017_2_1_Readme.htm).


#### <a name="5"></a>Forge Scopes Enforcement by May 22

As part of the continual Forge platform security improvements, enforcement of the scopes requirement for all access tokens will begin on **May 22, 2017**.

If you have apps created before June 15, 2016, you need to update your code so that any access tokens generated by your app request scopes.

Calls without scopes will be rejected after May 22.

For full details, please refer to
the [Forge OAuth scopes docs](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/scopes).


#### <a name="6"></a>Forge View and Data API Countdown

As said, the clock is running now.

Convert your existing app from the obsolete View and Data API to the [Forge Viewer API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v2/overview).

Itâ€™s been almost a year since the release of the 
Forge [Data Management API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/overview/),
[Model Derivative API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/),
and [Viewer JavaScript library](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v2/overview/) replacing
the original View and Data API.

Consequently, on **July 17, 2017** the View and Data API will close down.

Please migrate your code from the obsolete platform version `v1` to the new platform `v2` before July 17, 2017, or your application will stop working.

For more information, please refer to the detailed description 
on [migrating apps from Forge `v1` to `v2`](https://forge.autodesk.com/cloud_and_mobile/2016/09/autodesk-forge-apis-migrating-from-v1-to-v2.html).


#### <a name="7"></a>Forge DevCon Call for Speakers is Open

The [Forge DevCon call for speakers is open](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/forge-devcon-announces-call-proposals).

Are you interested in sharing your experience working with the Forge platform?

Have you creatively used Forge to enhance a project or solve a challenge?

If so, then come join other experts in a leadership role at [Forge DevCon](https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2017).

#### <a name="8"></a>Autodesk University Call for Proposals

As already mentioned, the Forge DevCon has been aligned
with [Autodesk University in Las Vegas](http://au.autodesk.com).

Autodesk University obvoisly remains the most important event of the year for all Autodesk technology not directly related to Forge programming, including Revit, its API and add-in development.

If you have anything you would like to share on any such subject,
please [submit your AU proposal by May 17](http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals).


#### <a name="9"></a>Five Autodeskers Speak at Women Who Code

Five female Autodeskers will take the stage at
the [Women Who Code conference](https://www.womenwhocode.com/) at Twitter HQ on Saturday April 29.
