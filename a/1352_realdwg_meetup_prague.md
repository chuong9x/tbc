### RealDWG, AutoCAD I/O, View &amp; Data API Meetup in Prague

Are you interested in reading or writing DWG files directly, without installing AutoCAD?

Querying? Viewing? Editing?

Would you like to expand your solutions to support mobile devices and the web?

Would you like to avoid implementing different or new application code to support desktop, mobile and web apps?

Hear about the most efficient, reliable and robust solutions at the upcoming
['I Love DWG' meetup](http://www.meetup.com/I-Love-DWG-Prague/events/225070857) in Prague next Tuesday evening, September 8.

Maybe you are already familiar with the Autodesk [RealDWG](http://www.autodesk.com/realdwg) library for reading and writing DWG files.

Are you also aware of the new [AutoCAD I/O](https://developer.autodesk.com/api/autocadio) web service?

It provides access to **AutoCAD on the Cloud** with much of the power and capability of a full desktop AutoCAD installation, tuned for web development.

Do you know about the [Autodesk View &amp; Data web service](http://developer-autodesk.github.io) that can help you deliver a customised viewing experience on any device in just a few hours of development time?

The View &amp; Data web service provides a broad and deep API and supports over 60 3D and 40 2D file formats, most of them non-Autodesk.

RealDWG, AutoCAD I/O and the translation engine driving the Autodesk View &amp; Data web service are all created from the same codebase, too.

[Adam Nagy](http://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/adam-nagy.html) and
[Kean Walmsley](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/about-the-author.html)
will be demonstrating a number of sample applications based on the AutoCAD I/O and View &amp; Data web services.

You’ll get to see how sites such as Kean's
[http://jigsawify.com](http://jigsawify.com) &ndash; based on AutoCAD I/O &ndash; and
[http://vrok.it](http://vrok.it/) &ndash; using the View &amp; Data API &ndash; are implemented.

Would you like to learn more?

Please [join us at the meetup](http://www.meetup.com/I-Love-DWG-Prague/events/225070857) next Tuesday evening, September 8<sup>th</sup>, from 6-9 pm at the Autodesk office in Prague, just a ten-minute drive from the Diplomat Hotel.

Questions?

Please do reach out!

You can contact both
[Adam](mailto:adam.nagy@autodesk.com) and
[Kean](mailto:kean.walmsley@autodesk.com) directly by email.

Also, if the timing of the meetup doesn’t work for you, please let us know: we have more time to chat during the afternoon of the 8<sup>th</sup> and the morning of the 9<sup>th</sup>.

I am hope you can make it! &nbsp; :-)
