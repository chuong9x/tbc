### Add-In Language and BIM360 Login

####<a name="2"></a> BIM360 Question? Join Accelerator!

A queick question on logging in to BIM360 from HÃ¥vard Vasshaug and Dimitar Venkov of
the [Bad Monkeys](https://www.badmonkeys.net) (not to be confused with the [thriller of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Monkeys) &ndash; featuring Jane, who claims that she works for a secret organization devoted to fighting evil and that she is the operative for the Department for the Final Disposition of Irredeemable Persons, also known as Bad Monkeys):

**Question:** We are using Revit Batch Processor to open multiple Revit models and run a selection of Python scripts on each in order to standardize their content and settings.

One client is asking if we can build it to support BIM360.

So, we wonder:

Can we use the secure sign-on that's already present in Revit (the one that gives users access through the Revit home screen), so that we can gain access to Forge, see the projects and files shared with that user and finally read the `project_Id` and `model_Id` of those files?

Do you know where we should be looking and who we should talk with?

**Answer:** That sounds cool, and the idea sounds good to me.

However, I have avoided involvement with security and credentials as much as possible, so I don't really know.

Your best bet for getting a reliable answer is to ask through
the [regular Forge help channels](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/support/get-help).

Better still, another approach yet more effective would be
to [join a Forge accelerator](https://forge.autodesk.com/accelerator-program) and ask there.

Since they are virtual nowadays, more people can participate.

That will guarantee you both an answer to your question and ensure you have ongoing support for the proof of concept.

You might even get your whole application completed right away during the accelerator.

How does that sound to you?

**Response:** I will check out the accelerator program for sure.

Thank you!

####<a name="3"></a> What Language to choose for a Revit Add-In?

**Question:** What language would you recommend me to start learning to program with Revit API?
Is [Python](https://www.python.org) fully functional by itself or does it needs [pyRevit](https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit) installed to work?
Can you program independent Applications with Python?

**Answer:** Here are my off-hand answers:

&gt; What language would you recommend me to start learning to program with Revit API?

Pick the one you like best. It must support .NET.

&gt; Is Python fully functional by itself?

No, because it does not support .NET out of the box. Therefore, you need some kind of .NET support for it to interact with Revit API.

&gt; Does it needs pyRevit installed to work?

No, not necessarily. That is one possible way to go. Another is the RevitPythonShell. Another is IronPython.

&gt; Can you program independent Applications with Python?

Yes, by including the .NET support in one way or another.

Anyway, what is 'independent'?

Every Revit add-in needs Revit to execute.

Depending on how your code is packaged, you may need Revit-plus-something.

I do all my work in C#, because then I am completely independent of all the complexities mentioned above.

However, I also sometimes like the flexibility of a Python command line.

The RevitPythonShell gives me that when I really need to dig deeper interactively.

By the way, you can also start off by writing macros instead of stand-alone add-ins.

The Revit macro environment supports both C# and Python right out of the box.
