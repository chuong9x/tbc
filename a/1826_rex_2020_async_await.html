  A REX problem appeared in Revit 2019 and was resolved by sharing a custom version of the REX SDK.
  Now the same problem occurs again with Revit 2020:

What a coincidence.
I also implemented my own async/await external event wrapper these days.
After some comparison with the one WhiteSharq provided, I found my implementation contains more useful functionality including wrapping async delegates and exposing core ability to define enhanced external events.
It internally adopts an `ExternalEvent` creator, so the developers won't accidentally experience the context problems.
Hope it can be helpful to the community.

Re: Family related memory leaks 
A possible alternative is to run Revit in headless mode. Totally contrary to the documented approach to create an add-in, you can start an application which hosts a Revit runtime within the same process which enables you to do what you want with the top-level Application object. Just like Navisworks.

In your case, for each project, start a headless Revit to finish your process, then close the application.

The problem is, for each project, there is a waste of boot time.

Since headless Revit don't start the renderer and anything about the UI, less memory will be consumed to make it possible to run serveral tasks in parallel on your machine. Moreover you can even set up a cluster to handle tons of projects in parallel which I believe is the key to enable Forge to resolve Revit files in cloud.

As to how to set up a headless Revit, find a file named lcldrevit.dll or lcrvtutil.dll(newer version of Navisworks) under {Navisworks root folder}\Loaders\Rx folder. By decompiling that file,  LcRevitLoad.DoInit() contains all you need to start your own headless Revit.

To make things easy enough, I created a library called Revit.Headless to do all that loading logic for you. Visit https://github.com/KennanChan/Revit.Headless for more details. Also it's available via nuget.
