Reading an RVT File without Revit #revitAPI #3dwebcoder @AutodeskRevit #bim #aec #adsk #adskdevnetwrk

A huge number of developers have requested a possibility to read or even write an RVT file without running Revit, similar to the possibility to read and write a DWG file without AutoCAD installed. For the latter, one option that has been around for ages is to make use of the RealDWG library for reading and writing DWG files. A more recent and future oriented option is provided by the cloud-based AutoCAD I/O web service.

<h3>Reading an RVT File without Revit</h3>
<p>A huge number of developers have requested a possibility to read or even write an RVT file without running Revit, similar to the possibility to read and write a DWG file without AutoCAD installed.</p>
<p>For the latter, one option that has been around for ages is to make use of the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/realdwg">RealDWG</a> library for reading and writing DWG files.</p>
<p>A more recent and future oriented option is provided by the cloud-based <a href="http://autocad.io">AutoCAD I/O</a> web service.</p>
<p>Here is yet another variation on this query:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any way that I can read a Revit model without having Revit installed on the users machine?</p>
<p>I'm thinking something similar to RealDWG for AutoCAD?</p>
<p>The closest I was able to find is your discussion
of <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/open-revit-ole-storage.html">Open Revit OLE Storage</a>.</p>
<p>However, I got the impression that this provides very limited and that it would not enable to extract, say, specific wall properties.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, the method that you refer to is extremely limited in the scope of information that can be accessed.</p>
<p>It is based on OLE structured storage, COM Structured Storage and the Compound File Binary Format.</p>
<p>One additional aspect of the structure storage format is that it also enables access to
so-called <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/lunar-eclipse-and-custom-file-properties.html#3">custom file properties on RVT and RFA files</a>,
since they are standard Windows properties stored there.</p>
<p>Here is another recent short overview
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/getting-started-creating-families-and-rfa-files.html#4">programmatically generating Revit family RFA files</a>.</p>
<p>There is a little bit more data that can indeed be accessed from family definition RFA files without running Revit using the <code>Application</code> <code>ExtractPartAtomFromFamilyFile</code> method:</p>

<p>Regarding the question you raise on full access to the RVT file contents without a Revit session up and running, we recently published a request for wishes concerning that area:</p>
