<h4><a name="3"></a> Accessing BIM360 Models</h4>
<p>Talking about Forge and cloud related topics, let's point out some new entries and finally an answer to 
the long-standing <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> discussion 
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/browsing-model-files-in-the-cloud-a360-c4r/m-p/8432797">browsing model files in the cloud (A360 C4R)</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> I need to set up a project on BIM360 Document Management, so I need to upload around 50 Revit files to BIM360 Doc. As Cloud Model, not Revit File, and I cannot do it with Dynamo, Python, Revit API or BIM360 Desktop Connector. How can I set up the project file on BIM360 Document Management? </p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I'm also interested in automating cloud collaboration for models so that they can be linked into Cloud Workshared Models rather than having users do that manually every time they receive a model. </p>
<p><strong>Question 3:</strong> We are also trying to achieve this. Lacking any other API for this, we created an add-in which stores the BIM360 central path to our DB while adding files to BIM360. From our DB, we populate a grid that shows all the files which were added.</p>
<p>For creating a local copy, I use the following method:</p>
<pre class="code">
  Document</span>&nbsp;OpenNewLocal(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Autodesk.Revit.ApplicationServices.<span style="color:#2b91af;">Application</span>&nbsp;app,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ModelPath</span>&nbsp;centralPath,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">ModelPath</span>&nbsp;localPath&nbsp;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Create&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;local&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;given&nbsp;path</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">WorksharingUtils</span>.CreateNewLocal(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centralPath,&nbsp;localPath&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre>

<p>Is this a valid approach for the current scenario?</p>
<p><strong>Question 4:</strong> Is there any possibility to create the URN for a Revit file which is stored in BIM 360 Design? </p>
<p>I have Model GUID and Project GUID in my hand.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The last question was also raised and answered by Eason Kang on StackOverflow, 
on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53538382/how-to-create-urn-for-revit-file-from-revit-plugin-or-using-forge-apis">how to create URN for Revit file from Revit plugin or using Forge APIs</a>:</p>
<p>While initializing the cloud collaboration in BIM360 Design via Revit's <code>Collaborate</code> button in the <code>Collaborate</code> tab &gt; <code>Manage Collaboration</code> panel, Revit will upload your model and simultaneously publish the first version of it to the BIM360 Document Management, aka BIM360 Docs.</p>
<p>After completing the initialization, you can use
the <a href="https://autodesk-forge.github.io">Forge</a>
<a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/developers_guide/overview">Data Management APIs</a> to
obtain model URNs in your BIM360 project, such
as <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-folders-folder_id-contents-GET">projects/:project_id/folders/:folder_id/contents</a>
or <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2/reference/http/projects-project_id-items-item_id-versions-GET/?_ga=2.69623760.1996415122.1543328615-671758876.1517749558">GET Versions</a>.</p>
<p>Afterward, iterate the items in the API response and find a version which matches the Model GUID and Project GUID you mentioned.</p>
<p>It will look something like this, and the <code>id</code> value is the URN you are after:</p>
<pre class="code">
{  
   "type":"versions",
   "id":"urn:adsk.wipprod:fs.file:vf.abcd1234?version=1",
   "attributes":{  
      "name":"fileName.rvt",
      "displayName":"fileName.rvt",
      ...
      "mimeType":"application/vnd.autodesk.r360",
      "storageSize":123456,
      "fileType":"rvt",
      "extension":{  
         "type":"versions:autodesk.bim360:C4RModel",
         ....
         "data":{  
            ...
            "projectGuid":"48da72af-3aa6-4b76-866b-c11bb3d53883",
            ....
            "modelGuid":"e666fa30-9808-42f4-a05b-8cb8da576fe9",
            ....
         }
      }
   },
   ....
}
</pre>
