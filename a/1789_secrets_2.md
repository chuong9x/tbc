### Secret Series 2


Joshua Lumley shares video #2 in his secret series,


####<a name="2"></a> Secrets of Revit API Coding Part 2

Last year, Joshua Lumley shared the recording he made for his BILT submission
on [five secrets of Revit API C# coding](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/five-secrets-of-revit-api-coding.html).

In his [comment today](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/08/zero-touch-node-element-wrapper-and-load-from-stream.html#comment-4646680624)
on [Loading a .NET assembly from a memory stream](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/08/zero-touch-node-element-wrapper-and-load-from-stream.html#3),
he points out part two, for this year's event:

> What really gets really tricky is when your addin references another DLL not provided by Microsoft's .net framework.

> I made a 43-minute video on how to do it with the Xceed Extended.Wpf.Toolkit, [cf. below](#3).

> It also avoids 'double' loading.

> Turn your Revit macro, that was initiated from macro manager into a proper plugin installer (an MSI files) you can distribute to other computers with no fuss.

> Includes use of Nuget packages: Extended WPF Toolkit & Ookii Dialogues.

> In the hope you will learn from my mistakes &ndash; throughout this lab I share a few embarrassing moments, where I spent many hours solving issues that turned out to have very simple resolutions.

Many thanks to Joshua for his great work and sharing!
