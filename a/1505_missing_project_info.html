<h3>Restoring a Missing Project Information Element</h3>
<p>Some people have recently reported that they encountered models lacking the <code>ProjectInfo</code> <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/e90b12f3-9bf4-f536-3556-c9944cbf9f38.htm">project information singleton element</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, it was possible in previous versions of Revit for a faulty or malicious add-in to simply delete this element.</p>
<p>That obviously causes problems for other add-ins and Revit itself, who rely on its presence.</p>
<p>Luckily, it is not hard to fix.</p>
<p>Here is the latest discussion addressing this issue:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I encountered models missing Project Information, causing errors to be thrown.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/missing_project_info.png" alt="Missing Project Information" width="500"/>
</center></p>
<p>Can you provide any guidance on a potential fix for this?</p>
<p>Can we perform a Transfer Project Standards like process to copy the project information in from another model?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can use the copy and paste API and
the <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/b22df8f6-3fa3-e177-ffa5-ba6c639fb3dc.htm">CopyElements method</a> to
copy in the project information element from some other intact RVT file.</p>
<p>The file can also be fixed via <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/troubleshooting/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Project-information-button-is-inactive-in-Revit.html">transfer project standards</a>.</p>
<p>We believe this problem to be fixed in Revit 2017 and later version, because API applications are now prevented from (hopefully accidentally) deleting the element.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thanks.</p>
<p>I have been successful in using the copy-paste method to automate the process to circumvent the errors and add the missing Project Information.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the help and suggestions!</p>
