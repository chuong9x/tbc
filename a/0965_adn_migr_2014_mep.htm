<h3>The ADN Sample AdnRme for Revit MEP 2014</h3>

<p>I am back safe and sound in Europe again, and the pressure to complete my preparations for the upcoming

Moscow Revit DevCamp</a> on

June 25<sup>th</sup> and

the Revit 2014 API training in Sydney in July is gradually growing.</p>

<p>As part of the preparation, I recently migrated the

The Building Coder samples</a> and

the

ADN Revit API training labs</a> to

Revit 2014, followed up by fixing most

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/removing-deprecated-api-compilation-warnings.html">
deprecated API usage</a> warnings

generated by The Building Coder samples.</p>

<p>I now also addressed the ADN Revit MEP sample

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-adn-mep-sample-adnrme-for-revit-mep-2013.html">
AdnRme</a>,

which turned out to be very easy indeed.</p>

<p>All I had to do was update the Revit API assembly references, and it compiled right away with zero errors and zero warnings.
That was a bit of a surprise.</p>

<p>Here is

<a href="zip/AdnRme_2014_0.zip">
AdnRme_2014_0.zip</a> containing

version 2014.0.0.0 of the AdnRme sample for Revit MEP 2014.</p>

<p>One thing I plan to do real soon now is post and host the ADN sample material on GitHub to make is easier to maintain and collaborate on.</p>
