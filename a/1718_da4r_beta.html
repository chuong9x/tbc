<h3>Design Automation for Revit in Public Beta</h3>
<p>The long-awaited public beta phase for Design Automation for Revit (aka Revit IO and DA4R) has finally arrived!</p>
<p><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/design-automation-revit-public-beta-here">The public beta is here</a> today.</p>
<p>Design Automation for Revit makes the power of the Revit API available as a Forge-based service.</p>
<p>Using Design Automation for Revit, you can create, edit, and extract data from Revit models without a local Revit install. Because Design Automation is a cloud service, you can use it to create cloud-native applications that work with Revit data. Examples of ways you can use this API include: creating models automatically by entering parameters, validating specified designâ€¯criteria and generating reports, and automatically modifying the model. It is also possible to extract model data not accessible with the Forge Model Derivative API.</p>
<p>For a high-level introduction, watch the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Data-Forge-How-Can-Design-Automation-Revit-API-Help-Me-2018">AU class recording</a>.</p>
<p>Our previous discussion of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/forge-design-automation-for-revit-at-au-and-in-public.html">Design Automation for Revit at AU and in public</a> highlights
both that class, FDC226894, by the Autodesk Revit API development team, and another, AS226079, on managing Revit digital content using DA4R, by external alpha phase developers.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview">Forge Design Automation documentation</a> has
been updated to include the new Revit functionality.</p>
<p>It includes a <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit">tutorial providing a good starting point to understand how DA4R works</a>.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to join the <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/key/Forge_Design_Automation_API_Revit">DA4R beta forum</a> to
see announcements and connect with the development team as well as other partners &amp; customers.</p>
<p>More tools and samples to help you get started with DA4R are in the works. Stay tuned...</p>
