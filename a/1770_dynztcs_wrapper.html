- Wrapper required to pass an element from Revit to Dynamo
  Trying to retrieve the DimensionType of a Dimension

  [Q] I'm trying to build a ZeroTouchNode with C# in Visual Studio that's input is a Dimension element and it's output is the DimensionType of that Dimension element. It seemed simple, but I'm having trouble returning the DimensionType element. Instead, the node is returning "Autodesk.Revit.DB.DimensionType". How do I retrieve the actual element? My code is included below. Thanks in advance for the help! 
  When I try to return the id, it returned the id of the dimension type, but not the dimension type element. Also, when I tried to return the element using the "Get Element" method and changed the return type to "Element" (as seen below) rather than "ElementType" as I had previously, it still gives me the same output.
  [A] You can not directly return a Revit class. You need to "wrap" into a Dynamo wrapper class.
  see [Become a Dynamo Zero Touch C# Node Developer in 75 Minutes](https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/become-a-dynamo-zero-touch-c-node-developer-in-75-minutes/28007)
  and download the handout.
  [R] Thank you for your help and for sharing the link with me. I worked through the concepts in that handout and got it working.
  Here's the working script :
    using Autodesk.Revit.DB;
    using RevitServices.Persistence;
    using Revit.Elements;
    namespace theWorks
    {
      public class Dimensions
      {
        private Dimensions() { }
        public static Revit.Elements.Element GetDimType(Revit.Elements.Element dimension)
        {
          Document doc = DocumentManager.Instance.CurrentDBDocument;
          Autodesk.Revit.DB.Element UnwrappedElement = dimension.InternalElement;
          ElementId id = UnwrappedElement.GetTypeId();
          ElementType dimType = doc.GetElement(id) as ElementType;
          return dimType.ToDSType(false);
        }
      }
    }  

- load .net assembly from memory stream
  [Assembly.Load Method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.load?view=netframework-4.8) Loads an assembly.
  [overload taking a Byte array arguyent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.assembly.load?view=netframework-4.8#System_Reflection_Assembly_Load_System_Byte___) Loads the assembly with a common object file format (COFF)-based image containing an emitted assembly. The assembly is loaded into the application domain of the caller.
  [Q] I am interested in how the revit addin manager manages (:wink:) to reload addins on the fly - in Dynamo we have the notion of packages which are similar to addins (a set of dlls or dynamo code we might need to load) - for dynamo code, reloading or unloading it can be done, but for .net dlls - my understanding is that in net framework (prior to the release of .net core 3) you cannot unload an assembly once loaded - how does the addin manager do this? Whos the owner and is the code in the revit repo? (edited)
  [A] i am not privy to the add-in manager source code, so i can only guess. you can load .NET code either from a DLL file on disk or from a stream in memory, cf. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40384619/how-to-load-assembly-from-stream-in-net-core. the add-in manager reads the DLL file on disk, converts it to a memory stream, and uses that to load the .NET code into the .NET environment. therefore, .NET never gets to see or touch (or lock) the DLL file.
