### Fire Rating Zone Intersection

Last week, we looked at some [3D intersection and filtering tasks](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/12/using-an-intersection-filter-for-linked-elements.html).

Now, let's tackle a 2D intersection one, brought up and solved 
by [Jack Bird](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/6830764) in

#### <a name="3"></a> 3D Solid Extrusion Creation and Intersection Task

**Question:** I’m finding it difficult to find any informative material on a subject in the API that I was hoping might have already been explored.

Specifically, I was hoping there would be an instance where a “model in place” void element is programmatically created in the model using given parameters for shape and dimensions.

For my purposes I was hoping to find a way to use an existing Solid Extrusion Element’s Geometry to define the geometry of this void as I create it.

The overall point would be to:

- Have a Transparent extrusion hidden in the model that represents the Property Boundary for the Site of the Building, and the area 900 mm in from it (like a 3D cubic Object that represents the legal fire rating zone).
- Create a list of elements from the exterior of the building that need to be tested for needing a fire proof layer; (such as Walls, Soffits ETC).

Then in the same transaction:

- Create a void Extrusion element the same shape and size as the Solid extrusion,
- Iterate through each of the elements in need of testing and attempt to cut them with the void,
- If the cut is successful record the cut area of the element that is being tested,
- Keep that as the area of that element that needs to be fire rated,
- Then, having tested all the relevant elements, Rolling back the transaction.

I don’t know if that is even possible, but I thought it might allow me to automatically store the required fire rated area for each element. All the drafts person has to do is draw in a Solid extrusion 900 mm wide and as tall as the building based on the plan of subdivision and hide it in the model.

I would be really stoked for any advice, references or links that seem relevant to the task. it would be much appreciated.

Here is an image that may help with visualizing the problem:

**Answer:** Here are some discussions dealing with various aspects of voids:

#### <a name="4"></a> 2D Area Intersection Task

Looking more closely at your descriptive image, the problem seems quite simple to me.

You have a certain area of interest, and certain elements that partially intersect the volume above it.

Instead of determining the intersecting volume, I would suggest retaining the area of interest in 2D, in the XY plane, and projecting the elements onto the XY plane as well.

Once you have everything in 2D in the XY plane, you have reduced the problem to a simple 2D Boolean intersection task.

That can be perfectly and completely addressed using a library to
compute [Boolean Operations for 2D Polygons](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.2).

**Response:** That  RvtClipper.zip  was a very useful resource thank you.
I had a play with the clipperlib on a previous task but did not consider putting it to use here.

I am currently working on adapting it to my aim and will update this post as soon as I've figured it out.

**Answer:** Great! I am very glad it helped.
I think this can be used to create a very optimal solution to the ask you describe.
I look forward very much to hearing what you come up with.

**Response:** Thanks again, that worked out really well.

In the end I swapped out the RvtClipper `Result` `Execute` method to return a <code>List&lt;CurveArray&gt;</code> and substituted the `doc.Selection` based component for two element parameters that I pass in when calling it: the boundary element and whichever element I am currently testing for an intersection as I iterate through them.

I then loop through the resulting `CurveArray` instances that it returns and:

- Subject the curve arrays to your `SortCurvesContiguous` method
- Convert them to CurveLoops,
- Check if the CurveLoop is open,
- If it is; I take the start of the first Curve and the end of the last Curve and add a new Curve to the loop using these vertices as its start and end,
- Convert the loop back to the Array,
- Apply your `SortCurvesContiguous` method again just to be sure,
- Lastly, just create a floor of a previously prepared type named "Fire Rated Layer" using these curves that sits just on top of the soffit that was being tested.

All in all, I'm chuffed with the outcome.

All the best and Thank You.

I would be glad to share the code and sample &ndash; I wonder though &ndash; as I have utilized this function as a component of a bigger two-part method &ndash; and have to some degree intertwined the two functions, would you still like to have it?

Furthermore, I have developed it to be reliant on several other methods, so it may seem somewhat verbose as a sample.

With all this taken into account, I wasn't sure if you would like to retract your offer as the sample will be quite large and not entirely focused on the topics touched on in this conversation.

I will outline the whole thing so you may consider.

The overall method now takes all of the soffits of a specific type (Named "Eave") and:

- First, spends some time breaking them into segments that replace the initial elements.
- Secondly, collects and subjects the new elements to the boundary overlap query, creating the fire rating layer elements.

Step one not being entirely relevant to step two, but contingent none the less.

Having gone back through and doing a bit of housekeeping, it is not as bad as I had apprehended.

Please forgive my habit of notating via regions, I have a bit of a thing for abstraction whilst I work.

It is all attached below.

#### <a name="5"></a> Jack's Sample and Description

Based on that discussion, Jack very kindly shared
a [complete soffit subdivision and fire rating sample](zip/jb_soffit_subdivision_and_fire_rating.zip) including
a [sample model](zip/jb_soffit_subdivision_and_fire_rating_example.rvt),
the [sample C# code below](#4) and the following description:

The notation within the sample will hopefully take care of most of the describing,

I would however like to make note of the fact that any time I use the term 'Soffit', it is because that is what 
the element in question represents as far as function goes. Where in reality the 'Soffits' are all floors.

The three types that are used in this sample are a floor named "Boundary", a floor named "Eave" and a floor named
"Fire Rated Layer". They have no particular properties that are essential to the method other than their names, 
as that is how I identify and collect them.

Other than that, the view in the model called "Isolated" is just the "Soffit" and the boundary by themselves;
that is the best view to test in, I find.

All the best.

Thanks.

#### <a name="7"></a> Cleanup and GitHub Repository

Very many thanks to Jack for creating, cleaning up and sharing this.

Very cool indeed.

I set it up and tested it by performing the following steps:

- Cleaned up the sample code
- Added minimal implementations for the missing `Triangle` and `TrianglePair` classes
- Downloaded and installed the [Clipper open source freeware library for clipping and offsetting lines and polygons](http://angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php)
- Implemented an external command to drive the code
- Tested it in the sample model

Here is a picture of the model:

<center>
<img src="img/fire_rating_zone_intersection_model.png" alt="Fire rating zone intersection model" width="477">
</center>

The result is a bunch of new floor elements:

<center>
<img src="img/fire_rating_zone_intersection_result.png" alt="Fire rating zone intersection result" width="691">
</center>

I published the cleaned-up sample in its own
new [FireRatingZoneIntersection GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingZoneIntersection).

Some things could be cleaned up further, I believe:

- Why convert the filtered element collectors to `List`?
- Why create floor elements? Wouldn't a simple model curve polyline do the job?
- Use a built-in parameter enumeration value and `get_Parameter` instead of `LookupParameter`.
- I tend to avoid `SetValueString` and use `Set` instead.

Still, I hope others find it useful as well, and look forward to seeing your pull requests for these and further enhancements.
