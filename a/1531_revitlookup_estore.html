<h3>RevitLookup Extensible Storage Restored</h3>
<p>I already discussed the first clean-up of the new <code>Reflection</code> based version 
of <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a>;
here comes the second one, restoring access to view extensible storage data:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Recent changes to RevitLookup</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Restore access to extensible storage data</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Download and access to old functionality</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Recent Changes to RevitLookup</h4>
<p>Here is an overview of the recent changes so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/revitlookup-using-reflection-for-cross-version-compatibility.html">Using <code>Reflection</code> for cross-version compatibility</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/revitlookup-with-reflection-cleanup.html">Basic clean-up</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On February 6, I presented a drastic change 
to <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a> contributed by 
Andy <a href="https://github.com/awmcc90">@awmcc90</a> McCloskey, <a href="https://twitter.com/revdevstudios">RevDev Studios</a>,
using <code>Reflection</code> to provide more complete coverage of all the Revit database element methods and properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100003616852588">Victor Chekalin</a>, aka Виктор Чекалин, took
a critical look at the new version and cleaned it up significantly to address some raw edges in 
his <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/25">pull request #25 &ndash; old bug fixes and improvements of the new approach </a>,
presented February 17.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Restore Access to Extensible Storage Data</h4>
<p>Alexander Ignatovich, <a href="https://github.com/CADBIMDeveloper">@CADBIMDeveloper</a>, aka Александр Игнатович, examined the new version and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I worked a lot with extensible storage in the past.
This theme remains important for me nowadays as well.
With the new <code>Reflection</code> approach, the extensible storage data display disappeared from RevitLookup.</p>
<p>Therefore, I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/26">pull request #26</a> to
the RevitLookup GitHub repo.</p>
<p>I restored the ability to see extensible storage content and made some refactorings.</p>
<p>I also added the ability to see GUID values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to Alexander for restoring this critical piece of functionality!</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Download and Access to Old Functionality</h4>
<p>The most up-to-date version is always provided in the master branch of 
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Alexander's enhancement is provided
in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.17">RevitLookup release 2017.0.0.17</a> and
later versions.</p>
<p>If you would like to access any part of the functionality that was removed when switching to the <code>Reflection</code> based approach, please grab it
from <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.13">release 2017.0.0.13</a> or earlier.</p>
<p>I am also perfectly happy to restore other code that was removed and that you would like preserved.
Simply create a pull request for that, explain your need and motivation, and I will gladly merge it back again.</p>
