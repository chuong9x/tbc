<h3>AU Day Two</h3>

<p>Kean pointed out a few of the 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/11/a-quick-aupdate.html">
things going on here at AU</a>, 

many of which directly affect me well.

<p>It is so exciting to meet all these people here doing impressive things and with innovative empowering projects, and also simply wonderful to catch up with colleagues that I have so much close virtual interaction with and otherwise seldom get to see face to face.

<p>And lots and lots of enthusiastic blog readers!

<p style="text-align:center; font-size:x-large; font-weight:bold; color:orange;">Thank you
<p style="text-align:center">for all your appreciation and support!

<p>I held my extensible storage class yesterday, and today I am conducting the associated hands-on lab, <b>CP6760-L</b> Autodesk Revit 2012 API Extensible Storage, at 13:15 in San Polo 3403.

<p>I will have the world's best team of assistants supporting me!

<p>After that, I plan to go to Scott Conover's session on geometry, <b>CP4011</b> Geometric Progression, in Delfino 4001B at 15:15.

<p>Finally, just like Kean, in case anyone at AU happens to be reading this and wants to say Hi, Ill be staffing the Global Services booth in the Exhibit Hall this afternoon sometime between six and seven pm and would love to see you there.

<p>Happy AUing, either live or virtual, and looking forward to seeing you!
