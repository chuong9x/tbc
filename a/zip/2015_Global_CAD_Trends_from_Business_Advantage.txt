￼Looking to the Future
￼￼￼￼￼Purpose
- Future planning is key for any business
- We want to assist you with future planning
- The Business Advantage Group is an international market research, data, sales development and consulting practice specializing in the CAD/CAM/CAE/PDM/PLM sectors
Methodology
- Annual Online survey in Nov, 2014. Data comparison with Dec, 2013 survey results
- The survey was managed from our offices in London and San Francisco, drawing respondents from our in-house data repository of over 500,000 CAD/CAM users and decision makers and other data sources
Get Involved
- 15 Topics and their perceived importance, actual and future usage related to CAD were captured, enabling us to identify key trends in the CAD sector now and over the next five years
- Please take a look at our top line results and let us know if you agree or disagree with our predictions. We would love to hear your thoughts

635 CAD users & decision makers across a range of company sizes and industries worldwide took part
￼￼￼3
￼￼￼
￼Key Topics
15 Key CAD trends were identified for the survey this year compared to 14 Key CAD trends last year, enabling us to do year-on-year comparison
- A series of questions were asked about each of the 15 CAD trends to get a better understanding of Awareness, Perceived Importance, Current Usage and Future Usage
Q. Awareness Q. Perceived Importance Q. Current and Future Usage
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Q: Which of the following leading trends are you familiar with or have heard of?
A prompted list was shown and respondents were asked to select all response options that apply
Q: Thinking about your core business functions, to what extent do you see each of these as an important trend to your company?
A rating scale of 1 to 10 used, where 1 is not at all important and 10 is extremely important to your company
Q: Thinking about these trends again what do you/your company already use in-house at the moment? and...
...plan on using in-house within the next 12 months?
... plan on using in-house within the next 3-5 years?

3D Modelling is a core and slow growth area in today’s market, with high importance and usage (both show an increase year-on-year). Future predicted growth potential is limited, due to majority already using 3D modelling.
Generally high current usage across industry sectors, and similarly high usage across regions and countries.
Small companies (1-50 employees) are less likely to be current users (although 7 in 10 still use).

Both importance and usage increased y-on-y, usage is more than double the forecast in 2014, although relatively limited predicted growth compared to other trends.
More likely to be used currently in large companies (55%) than small (26%) or medium (40%) companies.
Usage of Simulation is seen mostly for design optimisation (70%), design validation (63%) or mechanical simulation (62%) (based on those using or planning
to use simulation – 313)
Ease of use for less experienced designers would be a key driver in encouraging additional use of simulation software (52%) or a 50% cost reduction (33%). Expert support for usage guidance is generally expected as part of the package (47%).

￼Note on Analysis
YEAR-ON-YEAR SURVEY SAMPLE
- This study has been conducted in consecutive years. To ensure comparability and so that any changes in the results are true and not a result of different sample profiles, the 2015 CAD Trends data was adjusted by geographic region to be internationally representative and weighted by industry sector within the CAD market
- CAD Trend results were reviewed by individual sector and consolidated across all sectors. For the consolidated results, sectors within each tier were weighted equally: - Tier 1: AEC and Manufacturing
- Tier 2: Process & Plant and Other
- Tier 3: Education, Government and Utilities
￼46
￼￼￼
￼Technical Survey Information
- In looking at future usage, we have made the assumption that current usage will continue, therefore future usage is an incremental addition to current usage
- All differences mentioned within the report are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level
- Weighting factors applied as follows:
- Tier 1: AEC and Manufacturing – 34% weight
- Tier 2: Process & Plant and Other – 10% weight
- Tier 3: Education, Government and Utilities – 4% weight
- All bases shown in the report are un weighted – demonstrating the actual sample size, not its weighted equivalent
