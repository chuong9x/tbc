Question from truevis:

What do we have to change to get this to work in Revit 2017? Seems there are changes in DirectShape.CreateElement and TessellatedShapeBuilderResult.

Answer:

I migrated the sample to Revit 2017 for you.

Here is what i did:

- Updated the Revit API references
- Incremented the .NET framework from 4.5 to 4.5.2
- Reinstalled the FileFormatWavefront NuGet package
- Recompiled

That produces two warnings:

- Error CS1501 No overload for method 'Build' takes 3 arguments DirectObjLoader C:\a\vs\DirectObjLoader\DirectObjLoader\Command.cs 126 Active
- Warning CS0618 'DirectShape.CreateElement(Document, ElementId, string, string)' is obsolete: 'This function will be obsolete in Revit 2017. Use DirectShape.CreateElement(Document, ElementId) instead. Use DirectShape.ApplicationId, DirectShape.ApplicationDataId properties to set application id and application data id.' DirectObjLoader C:\a\vs\DirectObjLoader\DirectObjLoader\Command.cs 131 Active

The warning is completely self-explanatory and trivial.

The error is caused by the changes described in What's New in the Revit 2017 API:

**TessellatedShapeBuilder Changes**

The options for building are now set as options in the TessellatedShapeBuilder itself. Access these options through the new properties:

- TessellatedShapeBuilder.Target
- TessellatedShapeBuilder.Fallback
- TessellatedShapeBuilder.GraphicsStyleId

The build result is now accessible through GetBuildResult instead of being returned by the Build method.

I published a new released 2017.0.0.0 including the corresponding changes.

The flat migration works fine, and this image was produced as a result:

I am rather disappointed that you do not solve this yourself and create a pull request to share your solution.

What kind of one-way sharing is this supposed to be?
