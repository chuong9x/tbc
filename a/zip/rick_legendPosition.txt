dear rick,

thank you very much for the offer!

you can just send me an email with your suggestion, and we can edit it together.

pure ascii text or a word or rtf file is all perfectly ok, preferably with a complete zipped visual studio 
solution plus revit sample model and detailed steps to demonstrate the use.

thank you!

cheers
