# Nickname

In Design automation, your Forge App account will be the `owner` of your app and activity. 

A `nickname` is a way to map a Forge App ClientId to a customized string. A nickname lets you create a friendly, easy-to-read string that can be used in place of the long Forge App ClientId.

For example, your Forge App ClientId is something hard to read like `"YnhayiOjhgnsd&jsafh890ryehQW"` and you create a new app of `DeleteWallsApp` with an alias `test`. Now you can reference this `DeleteWallsApp` app by `YnhayiOjhgnsd&**afh890ryehQW.DeleteWallsApp+test`. 

However, by mapping this Forge App ClientId `"YnhayiOjhgnsd&jsafh890ryehQW"` to a nickname of `YourNickname`, you can reference the app by using `YourNickname.DeleteWallsApp+test`, more easily and nicely.
