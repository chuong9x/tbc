Setting up RvtSamples

All the VB.NET samples place their DLLs in the bin directory, not bin/Debug.

Fixed that.

Next error loading RvtSamples:

[Window Title]
RvtSamples External Application - RvtSamples

[Main Instruction]
External command class Revit.SDK.Samples.DatumsModification.CS.Command in assembly 'Y:\a\src\rvt\RevitSdkSamples\SDK\Samples\DatumsModification\CS\bin\Debug\DatumsModification.dll' specified in line 350 of RvtSamples.txt not found

[OK]

The DatumsModification sample does not implement an external command named `Command`.

It implements three, named DatumStyleModification, DatumAlignment and DatumPropagation.

Fixed that.

[Window Title]
RvtSamples External Application - RvtSamples

[Main Instruction]
Assembly 'Y:\a\src\rvt\RevitSdkSamples\SDK\Samples\Viewers\ElementViewer\VB.NET\bin\ElementViewer.dll' specified in line 875 of RvtSamples.txt not found

[OK]

ElementViewer.dll is in the bin\Debug subfolder after all.

So are CreateShared, TestFloorThickness and TestWallThickness.
