### That BIM Girl and AskNow

I ate a dubious mushroom Saturday evening with dire consequences.

In spite of that, I managed the trip to Rome Sunday afternoon and am now happy to be here at 
the [Forge accelerator](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com) together
with my Autodesk colleagues and the other attending companies.

Before diving in further into the accelerator, I would like to point out the new inspiring AEC resources shared by That Bim Girl, and also post some notes to self on Q4R4:

No need for many words from me to present That BIM Girl,
aka [Jacqueline Rohrmann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-rohrmann-b17130141),
student at the [Technical University of Munich, TUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_University_of_Munich)
since she does a perfect job of it herself, e.g., in
this 43-second [trailer on coding for AEC](https://youtu.be/Ra9qIPEz-kg), [#CfAEC](https://twitter.com/search?q=CfAEC):

Specifically, here are the first two episodes on getting started writing a Revit add-in:

#### <a name="3"></a> Notes to Self on AskNow for Q4R4

My [Q4R4 project](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/r4q4) has been dormant for quite a while.

However, I just noticed a research project that seems as if it could cover all that I need and more, [AskNowQA](https://github.com/AskNowQA):

The [Smart Data Analytics group](http://sda.tech) announced [AskNow 0.1, an initial release of Question Answering Components and Tools over RDF Knowledge Graphs](http://sda.cs.uni-bonn.de/asknow-0-1-released):

- [Website](http://asknow.sda.tech)
- [Demo](http://asknowdemo.sda.tech)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA)

The following components with corresponding features are currently supported by AskNow:

- EARL 0.1 EARL performs entity linking and relation linking as a joint task. It uses machine learning in order to exploit the Connection Density between nodes in the knowledge graph. It relies on three base features and re-ranking steps in order to predict entities and relations. 
    - [ISWC 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.03825.pdf)
    - [Demo](https://earldemo.sda.tech)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/EARL)
- SQG 0.1: This is a SPARQL Query Generator with modular architecture. SQG enables easy integration with other components for the construction of a fully functional QA pipeline. Currently entity relation, compound, count, and Boolean questions are supported.
    - [ESWC 2018](http://jens-lehmann.org/files/2018/eswc_qa_query_generation.pdf)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/SQG)
- AskNow UI 0.1: The UI interface works as a platform for users to pose their questions to the AskNow QA system. The UI displays the answers based on whether the answer is an entity or a list of entities, Boolean or literal. For entities it shows the abstracts from DBpedia. 
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/AskNowQA/AskNowUI)
- SemanticParsingQA 0.1: The Semantic Parsing-based Question Answering system is built on the integration of EARL, SQG and AskNowUI.
