<h3>Rotate True North</h3>

<p>We have previously looked at how to handle the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/project-location.html">
project location</a> properties 

and more specifically how to handle the effect of a 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/unrotate-north.html">
rotated Project North</a> on

an element azimuth.

<p>Here is a question on the 'opposite' topic, how to set up a project north rotation in the first place:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any way to rotate the truth north using the Revit API? 

<p>It can be done in the user interface using the Manage &gt; Project Location &gt; Position &gt; Rotate True North command:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/rotate_true_north_jp.png" alt="Rotate True North in Japanese"/>
</center>

<p>Here is the English command with its expanded tooltip:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/rotate_true_north_en.png" alt="Rotate True North in English"/>
</center>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I believe the same effect can be achieved by rotating the <b>Project</b> North which is available in the API.

<p>If this fits the bill, then here are some working code snippets making use of the related classes and methods:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="teal">ProjectLocation</span> plCurrent
&nbsp; &nbsp; = _doc.ActiveProjectLocation;
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="green">// . . . </span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="teal">ProjectPosition</span> newPosition
&nbsp; &nbsp; = _app.Create.NewProjectPosition(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scaleToFT * cs.OriginX,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scaleToFT * cs.OriginY,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scaleToFT * cs.OriginZ,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; theRotationYouWant );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; plCurrent.set_ProjectPosition(
&nbsp; &nbsp; ptOrigin, newPosition );
</pre>

<p>You may have to do this for <b>all</b> project locations.
A bit of 3D maths and brainwork may be required, but it should be doable.

<p>Many thanks to Katsuaki Takamizawa and Miroslav Schonauer for this discussion and suggestion!

Hi Jeremy,

This developer seems to really need the true north rotation. 
If that is the case, rotating all project north would not be the solution (though I do not know what is really missing by doing it).

Thank you,
Katsu

Hi Katsu,

Did you mean 'solution (though I do NOT know what is really missing by doing it).' 

If I'm wrong than pls can you summarise what it is - otherwise you may ask developer to explain.

Cheers,

Miro
