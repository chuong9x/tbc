A discussion by AEC Magazine -- https://aecmag.com -- of the past, present, potential future of Revit and the long-term Autodesk vision for BIM:

What comes after Revit? Autodesk aims to reinvent collaborative BIM -- https://aecmag.com/technology-mainmenu-35/1821-beyond-revit-autodesk-seeks-to-reinvent-collaborative-bim

In 2016, Autodesk announced Project Quantum, described as a platform technology for “evolving the way BIM works, in the era of the cloud, by providing a common data environment”. The project then went dark but now it’s back and called Project Plasma

Awe inspiring
Data Contracts and Escrow
Quality issues
Asynchronous vs Synchronous
Speeding up Revit?
Revit development
Replacing Revit
Typical customers
Timeframe
Conclusion

The 'awe inspiring' section is based on an interview with chief software architect Jim Awe.

Data contracts also mention blockchain and other, more lightweight, legally secure and binding technologies.

####<a name="4"></a> mikako's da4r overview

I have been rather silent lately on the topic
of [DA4R, Design Automation for Revit](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.55),
mainly due to the fact that my more Forge-focussed colleagues are dealing with that more than I am.

Mikako harada now also published her own overview
of [DA for Revit &ndash; Learning Materials](https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com/2019/05/24/da-for-revit-learning-materials)
and [Where to Get Help about Forge](https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/27/where-to-get-help-about-forge) that
you might want to check out.
