### Cloud Model Predicate, and Set Parameter Regenerates

The [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) continues 
to reach ever new levels of depth and coverage.

Here are a couple of recent topics:

- [Welcome to the top solution authors, Jim!](#2)
- [Setting a parameter to regenerate the model](#3)
- [Checking model for C4R versus local file](#4)

####<a name="3"></a>Setting a Parameter to Regenerate the Model

We have frequently discussed
the [need to regenerate](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.33) the
model or individual elements and various ways to achieve that efficiently.

Another aspect of this and a simple solution came up in the thread
on [new sloped roof not visible](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/new-sloped-roof-not-visible/m-p/7574411):

**Question:** I have a problem creating a new sloped roof using code.

I use the basic sample shown in the developer guide and The Building Coder article
on [creating a roof](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/09/revit-answer-day-and-creating-a-roof.html).

I create a new `FootPrintRoof`, set `DefinesSlopes` to true for each model curve, and assign a `SlopeAngle`.

My macro doesn't have errors, but I can't see the new roof in any view.

I can find it only in a roof schedule, but I cannot see the 3D element.

I have tried to refresh the view in the code and I have noticed that the roof appears on the screen only for one second and then it disappears again.

I have tried using Basic roof and Sloped glazing, but it still doesn't work.

If I don't set the sloping, I can create a planar roof without any issue

What is the problem with the slope angle?

How can I solve that and make the sloped roof visible?

**Answer:** I solved the problem.

Now, I create my sloped glazing and then simply set one of its parameters using the API.

I've tried many different parameters, using either parameters connected to the UI and descriptive parameters: all of them are ok to regenerate the correct visualization of the sloped glazing.
 
This is my trick, I hope it is useful!

If anyone has a better way, please let me know.

Many thanks

####<a name="4"></a>Checking Model for C4R versus Local File

A new issue was raised and solved in the long discussion
on [browsing model files in the cloud](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/browsing-model-files-in-the-cloud-a360-c4r/m-p/6537130):

**Question:** Does anyone know how to check whether this file is C4R versus a local file?

Is it simply file extension, or a document property?

**Answer:** There's an internal property `IsModelInCloud` on the `Document` object in the Revit API that you can access using reflection:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">public</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">static</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>&nbsp;GetIsModelInCloud(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Document</span>&nbsp;document&nbsp;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">PropertyInfo</span>&nbsp;p&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">typeof</span>(&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Document</span>&nbsp;).GetProperty(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;IsModelInCloud&quot;</span>,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BindingFlags</span>.NonPublic&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BindingFlags</span>.Instance&nbsp;);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">return</span>&nbsp;(<span style="color:blue;">bool</span>)&nbsp;p.GetValue(&nbsp;document&nbsp;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}</pre>
</pre>
