  Compiling addins for multiple revit versions from the same codebase
  I have created a blog post about compiling addins for multiple revit versions from the same codebase.

  .net core should also work in Visual Studio 2015, but haven’t tested this.

- for my own reference, a very handy [Markdown tutorial](http://eherrera.net/markdowntutorial).
  Where do I use markdown?
  I use it to edit all my blog posts, and I use it in Slack.
  Please refer to the [tbd GitHub repository for The Building Coder blog posts markdown source]()

<h4><a name="2"></a>Compiling Add-Ins for Multiple Revit Versions</h4>
<p>I met <a href="http://buildingknowledge.eu/about">Sander Obdeijn</a> at several Autodesk, Forge and Revit and came to value his deep Revit experience, both in the user interface and API.</p>
<p>Happily, Sander now says, I'm also joining the blogosphere and my opening post will be about using custom MSBuild target files to easily compile add-ins for multiple Revit versions from the same codebase:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://buildingknowledge.eu/custom-msbuild-targets-for-compiling-addins-for-multiple-revit-versions">Custom MSBuild targets for compiling addins for multiple Revit versions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That is indeed good news!</p>
<p>Welcome, Sander!</p>
<p>I asked whether his approach might also be used in Visual Studio 2015, and he replies, '.NET core should also work in Visual Studio 2015, but haven’t tested this'.</p>
