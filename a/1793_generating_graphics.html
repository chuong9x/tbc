<h3>Generating Graphics</h3>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Avoid Generating Graphics</h4>
<p>Several developers encountered performance problems filtering for elements based on the view containing them.</p>
<p>In order to determine which elements are displayed in a view, the view has to be regenerated.</p>
<p>The first time this happens, Revit may display a progress bar saying 'Generating graphics'.</p>
<p>This can be triggered by a filtered element collector as well.</p>
<p>In the following, I'll summarise a couple of discussions around this topic.</p>
<p>The most recent was is the StackOverflow question
on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58593436/revit-get-all-viewsheet-is-very-slow">Revit : get all ViewSheet is very slow</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> For a plugin, I need to get all the viewsheets in the RVT file and display information from them in a XAML dialog.
This process is very very slow the first time I use it:
with the debuger, it takes 500 ms for 83 plan views, and it is very slow without the debuger too.
If I execute the code again, the execution is instantaneous.
This code is causing it:</p>
<pre class="code">
  protected IEnumerable&lt;Element&gt; GetAllEl( Document doc )
  {
    return new FilteredElementCollector( doc )
      .OfCategory( BuiltInCategory.OST_Sheets )
      .WhereElementIsNotElementType()
      .OfClass( typeof( ViewSheet ) );
  }
</pre>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I do not think there is currently a known generic solution for that problem.</p>
<p>A similar issue was just discussed with the development team:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> for a given element id, we need to find the list of sheet ids displaying it.
Current solution: we loop through all the sheets and views and use <code>FilteredElementCollector( doc, sheet.Id )</code>.
With the results from that, we perform one more call to <code>FilteredElementCollector( doc, view.Id )</code> and look for the element id.
Issue: the current solution takes a lot of time and displays a Revit progress bar saying <code>Generating graphics</code>.
Is there any better way to know if a given element id is available in the sheet or not?
For example, some API methods like this would be very useful:</p>
<pre class="code">
  getAllSheets(ElementId) // returns array of sheet id
  hasGuid(ElementId,sheetId) // return true/false
</pre>

<p>Does the API provide any such methods, to check whether a given <code>ElementId</code> is available in the sheet?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> So the goal is to find a view that displays a particular element on a sheet?
Many model elements could be visible on multiple views, while most annotation elements are typically present only in one view.
What type of elements are you checking for?
And what will you do with that info?</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> The goal is to find a view that displays a particular element on a sheet.
It can be any type of element.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Here are some previous related discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/12/determining-views-showing-an-element.html">Determining Views Showing an Element</a></li>
<li>The inverse, <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/retrieving-elements-visible-in-view.html">Retrieving Elements Visible in View</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> The problem is that the first call to <code>FilteredElementCollector( doc, viewId )</code> shows <code>generating graphics</code> in the progress bar.
Only the first time search does so.
The second time, search on the same view has no issues with performance.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The first time is slow because in order to iterate on the elements visible in a view, the graphics for that view must be generated.
I can't think of a workaround to get a precise answer.
You might be able to skip sheets which don't have model views in their viewport list to save a bit of time.
Some sheets may only have drafting views and schedules and annotations.</p>
<p>The development team provided a very helpful suggestion which helped work around the <code>generating graphics</code> call by avoiding that specific filtering operation completely in another case,
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/loop-through-sheets-generating-graphics/m-p/8719256">Loop through sheets - generating graphics</a>.</p>
<p>The solution there awas to analyse exactly what relationship you are trying to retrieve.
The Revit API supports the inverse relationship directly, so you can retrieve that and invert it to access the required elements.</p>
<p>Maybe you can optimise in a similar manner for your specific case?</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Read all Thermal and Physical Assets</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a way to get the list of all Thermal and Physical assets using Revit 2019 API?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Those are used in Materials. I think you'd want to iterate over all Materials in the document, and look at each for its StructuralAssetId and ThermalAssetId.   You can then look at the PropertySetElements that use those ids.   You could probably also iterate PropertySetElements directly, which would be fine if you don't need to know what Materials are using them.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thanks, just now got them as you suggested from the below link
Material Assets Collector: Appearance, Structural (Physical) &amp; Thermal
https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/material-assets-collector-appearance-structural-physical-amp/m-p/7269088</p>
<p>We are trying to gather all the material assets loaded into a project file, but ran into a roadblock. We can successfully do this for the appearance assets, but for the other assets the approach does not work.</p>
<p>The only way that we can gather the structural and thermal assets is by starting with materials and cycle through the assets that are assigned. This approach will omit assets that are not assigned to materials.</p>
<p>Please see C# code below for reference. Any insight into how this can be achieved will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>FilteredElementCollector collector = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);
//code works for appearance assets
ICollection<Element> appearanceAssets = collector.OfClass(typeof(AppearanceAssetElement)).ToElements();
//code throws an error
ICollection<Element> physicalAssets = collector.OfClass(typeof(StructuralAssetClass)).ToElements();
//code throws an error
ICollection<Element> physicalAssets2 = collector.OfClass(typeof(StructuralAsset)).ToElements();
//code returns zero elements
ICollection<Element> propertySet = collector.OfClass(typeof(PropertySetElement)).ToElements();
//code throws an error
ICollection<Element> thermalAssets = collector.OfClass(typeof(ThermalAsset)).ToElements();</p>
<p>Error:</p>

Re: Material Assets Collector: Appearance, Structural (Physical) &amp; Thermal
Additional info:</p>
<p>We are working with the Revit 2016 API for compatibility.</p>
<p>Other observations:</p>
<p>The reason the Appearance Assets works might be because the "AppearanceAssetElement" class is called out. Appearance asset also has the "AppearanceAsset" which seems similar to the "StructuralAsset" and "ThermalAsset" classes. However, there are no "StructuralAssetElement" or "ThermalAssetElement" classes.</p>
<p>The appearance asset also has a builtin category "OST_AppearanceAsset" while the structural or thermal assets do not have a builtin category.</p>

Re: Material Assets Collector: Appearance, Structural (Physical) &amp; Thermal
Structural and Thermal Assets should be contained in PropertySetElement.  So the line you wrote filtering for that should work.  I checked in one of our templates and found 62 elements matching the filter.</p>

Re: Material Assets Collector: Appearance, Structural (Physical) &amp; Thermal 
Scott,</p>
<p>Thank you for your direction. The reason zero elements were collected in our previous code was because we used the same collector element for the appearance assets and the propertySet. As soon as we defined a new one "collector2", it worked.</p>
<p>The  propertySet element hosts thermal and structural assets. However, there can be two property sets that have the same name (Air for example) and one property set is dedicated to the structural while the other to the thermal. You cannot easily discern whether setting the property set element to a material will set the thermal or structural assets. Essentially, the property set is either thermal or structural when applied to a material.</p>
<p>It seems like the Revit UI categorizes propertysets further into thermal and structural categories, while API access is limited.</p>
<p>Below is an attempt to try to categorize the propertyset elements. Some property sets return a null value when the thermal asset info is missing and vice-versa.</p>
<p>//property set: thermal and structural
            FilteredElementCollector collector2 = new FilteredElementCollector(doc);
            ICollection<Element> propertySet = collector2.OfClass(typeof(PropertySetElement)).ToElements();</p>
<pre><code>        //loop through property sets to gather structural and thermal assets
        foreach (PropertySetElement psEle in propertySet)
        {
            try
            {
                //gather
                StructuralAsset structAsset = psEle.GetStructuralAsset();

                //process - currently add both aspects of property set if they exist
                //this method can have same p-set element id in both thermal and structural
                if (structAsset != null)
                {
                    structuralAssets.Add(psEle);
                }
            }
            catch
            {
                //code
            }
            try
            {
                //gather
                ThermalAsset thermAsset = psEle.GetThermalAsset();

                //process - currently add both aspects of property set if they exist
                //this method can have same p-set element id in both thermal and structural
                if (thermAsset != null)
                {
                    thermalAssets.Add(psEle);
                }
            }
            catch
            {
                //code
            }

        }
</code></pre>
<p>The image below shows the ThermalAsset data extracted from a propertySet originally assigned to a StructuralAssetID of a material.</p>
<p>pr.png</p>
<p>If the propertyset elements that host primarily the structural assets can be separated from the ones that host the thermal assets, then we would have to lists of property sets that we can work with.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get all the list directly instead of checking the PropertySetElements?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Checking the elements is the only way to get into the Document's database for these items.</p>

[A] I have good news for you.
You do not need to install Revit on your development machine.
All you need are the Revit API .NET assemblies.
As a minimum, they include RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll.
There are many more that are optional.
You can even create a NuGET package to deploy them to your development machine, or possibly use an existing one:
