### Forge Proposals and Autodesk University Papers

In the beginning of the week, I listed
my [things to do](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/room-editor-first-revit-2017-addin-migration.html#1) next,
including the most important and exciting one, attending and presenting at
the [Forge DevCon](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/room-editor-first-revit-2017-addin-migration.html#2) developer conference in San Francisco June 15-16.

My to-do list also includes
the [Forge accelerators](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com) being held
in Barcelona May 16-20 and in San Francisco June 19-24.

I did not mention Autodesk University there, because it is still far away.

However, now the calls for proposals have opened for both AU and the Forge accelerator in San Francisco, so it's time to put on your thinking and writing hats and get going on them:

- [Forge Accelerator &ndash; call for proposals](#2)
- [Autodesk University call for papers](#3)



#### <a name="2"></a>Forge Accelerator &ndash; Call for Proposals

As part of our [Forge DevCon](http://forge.autodesk.com/conference) week, we scheduled the next [Autodesk Forge Accelerator](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com) (formerly known as Cloud Accelerator) for June 19-24 inclusive in our San Francisco office. If your application is accepted, you will spend the week in our office working on your projects that make use of Autodesk Forge APIs &ndash; with the direct face-to-face help of ADN DevTech and members of the Autodesk engineering teams. The Autodesk Forge APIs include the View & Data, AutoCAD I/O, BIM 360, RecCap Photo and Fusion 360 APIs, as well as a number of exciting new APIs that will be launched at the conference. A full list of APIs is provided at [forge.autodesk.com](http://forge.autodesk.com).

To apply for this program, please submit a proposal of not more than 2000 words describing the project you'd like to work on and how it will make use of the Forge APIs. More information on how to apply is available at [autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/apply).

Proposals for suitable projects will be accepted as they come in, so don't wait too long!

We are looking forward very much to receiving your application.

We are deliberately scheduling this accelerator the week directly after Forge DevCon, so you can come for the conference, spend the weekend at the hackathon (details to be announced soon), and then attend the accelerator, all in one trip.

Why not register for the [Forge DevCon](http://forge.autodesk.com/conference) right now as well?

#### <a name="3"></a>Autodesk University call for Proposals

The [AU 2016](http://au.autodesk.com) dates were announced a month ago
for [13 AU International events](http://au.autodesk.com/#conferences.html).

[AU Las Vegas](http://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas) is coming up a bit earlier than usual this year, November 15-17.

As you probably know, this annual event is the largest Autodesk user conference, with hundreds of classes and labs taught by top-notch instructors and industry professionals.

The call for proposals is now open, and the deadline is in a month, on May 27.

Speaking at AU is a great opportunity for you to share your knowledge and expertise with designers, engineers, educators, and creative professionals from all around the world.

Connect with peers and contribute to the future of making things!

Visit the [AU Call for Proposals website](http://au.autodesk.com/speaker-resource-center/call-for-proposals) to learn more, including hot topics for 2016, and to submit your proposal.
