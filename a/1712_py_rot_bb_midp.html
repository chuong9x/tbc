<h4><a name="1"></a> Cyril's Python HVAC Blog</h4>
<p>You can see below why this discussion also prompted me to look at
Cyril's very nice <a href="http://pythoncvc.net">Python HVAC blog</a>.</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome on this website which promotes and provides scripts and applications for HVAC and BIM purposes.
These are written in Python language.</p>
<p>When I started my career, I wished I had many time saver tools.
Many people don't realise how much time you can save with just a few lines of code.
In my opinion, everything which can be automated should be.
A human being is here to use his mind, not to copy, paste and input data which doesn't need any brain.</p>
<p>Why Python? Because it is handy, interactive, open source and cross platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pythoncvc.net/?page_id=302">Cyril's FAQ</a> includes very useful information and resources for getting started with his own <a href="https://github.com/CyrilWaechter/pyRevitMEP">pyRevitMEP MEP extensions for pyRevit</a>, Python and the base Revit API.</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a> Rotating Elements Around Their Centre in Python</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am trying to rotate Revit elements about their centre points.
In order to do that, I need to select a Revit element and find its centre point, then create a line with the coordinates at that point.</p>
<p>My best idea to accomplish this is to wrap a Revit element in a bounding box and then find the centre of that box.
My problem is that I am unsure how to accomplish this.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/eirannejad/pyRevit">pyRevit</a> (amazing tool) and I am stuck on how to either wrap the selected element with a bounding box or retrieve its existing bounding box.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!
I am really trying to learn the Revit API and understand how everything works.
I am making progress but there is a lot to unpack.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  def pickobject():
    from Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection import ObjectType

    #define the active Revit application and document
    app = __revit__.Application
    doc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument.Document
    uidoc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument

    #define a transaction variable and describe the transaction
    t = Transaction(doc, 'This is my new transaction')

    # Begin new transaction
    t.Start()

    # Select an element in Revit
    picked = uidoc.Selection.PickObject(ObjectType.Element, "Select something.")

    ### ?????????? ###

    # Get bounding box of selected element.
    picked_bb = BoundingBoxXYZ(picked)  

    # Get max and min points of bounding box.
    picked_bb_max = picked_bb.Max
    picked_bb_min = picked_bb.Min

    # Get center point between max and min points of bounding box.
    picked_bb_center = (picked_bb_max + picked_bb_min) / 2

    ### ?????????? ###    

    # Close the transaction
    t.Commit()

    return picked, picked_bb_center
</pre>

<p>Thanks in advance for taking a look at what I have so far.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Retrieve Element and Bounding Box from Picked Reference</h4>
<p>The centre of the bounding box is very easy to obtain.
<code>picked</code> is a <code>Reference</code>.
Get the <code>ElementId</code> from that, open it using <code>doc.GetElement</code>, and retrieve the bounding box using <code>get_BoundingBox</code>,
cf. this code snippet from the discussion
of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/03/create-2d-arc-and-filter-for-intersecting-elements.html#3">conduits intersecting a junction box</a>:</p>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Element</span>&nbsp;e&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Util</span>.SelectSingleElement(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uidoc,&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;a&nbsp;junction&nbsp;box&quot;</span>&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BoundingBoxXYZ</span>&nbsp;bb&nbsp;=&nbsp;e.get_BoundingBox(&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>&nbsp;);
</pre>

<p>For certain elements and certain irregular shapes, you might want to use the centroid instead of the bounding box:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/12/solid-centroid-and-volume-calculation.html">Solid centroid and volume calculation</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/dynamo-centroid-volume-calculation-migration-blitz.html#3">GetCentroid on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="4"></a> Use Location Point Instead of Bounding Box Centre?</h4>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Is it not more interesting to use <code>LocationPoint</code> instead in your case? In my case it is almost always better. You might be interested to take a look at the two-minute video showing my tool,
a <a href="https://youtu.be/60Y_DJbIL5Y">Revit API 3D rotate script for pyRevit</a>, and its <a href="https://github.com/CyrilWaechter/pyRevitMEP/tree/master/pyRevitMEP.tab/Tools.panel/Element3DRotation.pushbutton">source code</a>:</p>

</center></p>
<p>I describe the script shown in the video in full detail in
the <a href="http://pythoncvc.net">Python HVAC blog</a> in the article
on a <a href="http://pythoncvc.net/?p=255">script rotating elements in any direction</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thanks for this! </p>
<p>I think you are right. Using <code>LocationPoint</code> would probably make more sense.</p>
<p>I looked through the script you linked (thank you btw!) and tried implementing this section in my code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  transform = doc.GetElement(picked.ElementId).GetTransform()
</pre>

<p>I am passing the <code>ElementId</code> through this statement, but I get an error saying that the <code>Wall</code> object has no attribute <code>GetTransform</code>. Could you please help me understand this?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Because, as said in the error message, the <code>GetTransform</code> method do not exist for a <code>Wall</code> class instance.</p>
<p>Have you tried to use <code>ElementTransformUtils</code> instead?</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Final Working Solution</h4>
<p>Here is how I was able to solve my problem using pyRevit. This code allows you to rotate an element about its Z axis from the centre of its bounding box.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  def pickobject():
    from Autodesk.Revit.UI.Selection import ObjectType

    #define the active Revit application and document
    app = __revit__.Application
    doc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument.Document
    uidoc = __revit__.ActiveUIDocument

    #define a transaction variable and describe the transaction
    t = Transaction(doc, 'This is my new transaction')

    # Begin new transaction
    t.Start()

    # Select an element in Revit
    el = uidoc.Selection.PickObject(ObjectType.Element, "Select something.")

    # Get the element from the selected element reference
    el_ID = doc.GetElement(el)      

    # Get the Bounding Box of the selected element.
    el_bb = el_ID.get_BoundingBox(doc.ActiveView)

    # Get the min and max values of the elements bounding box.
    el_bb_max = el_bb.Max
    el_bb_min = el_bb.Min

    # Get the center of the selected elements bounding box.
    el_bb_center = (el_bb_max + el_bb_min) / 2

    #Create a line to use as a vector using the center location of the bounding box.
    p1 = XYZ(el_bb_center[0], el_bb_center[1], 0)
    p2 = XYZ(el_bb_center[0], el_bb_center[1], 1)
    myLine = Line.CreateBound(p1, p2)

    # Rotate the selected element.
    ElementTransformUtils.RotateElement(doc, el, myLine, converted_value)

    # Close the transaction
    t.Commit()
</pre>
