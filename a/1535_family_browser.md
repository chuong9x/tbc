### WPF Revit Family Browser and Vacation

Just for your information, I am away on vacation now.

Please don't expect any Revit API related activity from me here, on
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160),
or anywhere else during the coming week.

Happily, I have something else to share with you and possibly help keep you busy and entertained in the meantime:

[Roman Lavrov](https://github.com/RomanLavrov) shared
his [Revit Family Browser](https://github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser), saying:
