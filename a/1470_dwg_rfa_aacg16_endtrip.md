- general advice: do not import DWG instances into a family definition
  CAD import into a family is considered bad content
  you want to put in a native lines etc. and not an imported cad family
  an imported cad family in a family definition will cause perform,ance issues and slow down revit
  they get duplicated in the project
  depends on how detailed and complicated the cad import is

### Avoid CAD Import in RFA, AAG16 and Endtrip

Some interesting topics of the day for this first cloudy one after a truly wonderful Indian summer:

- [Advances in Architectural Geometry 2016](#3)
- [Endtrip full sound replacement](#4)


#### <a name="2"></a>Avoid Imported CAD Content in RFA Family Definitions

I was in a meeting with Sasha Crotty, Revit API Product Manager, last week, and she mentioned an important aspect of content creation that I was not previously fully aware of:

Here is some general advice on creating Revit families: do not import DWG instances into a family definition.

CAD import into a family is considered bad content.

As much as possible, you would want to define a family using native Revit geometry native lines etc., not imported CAD data.

An imported CAD object in a family definition will cause performance issues and slow down Revit.

It gets duplicated in the project for every family instance placed.

Obviously the degradation will depend on the detail and complexity of the CAD content, and the replication of the family instances.

In general, though, it is to be avoided.

As if we couldn't have guessed...

#### <a name="4"></a>Endtrip Full Sound Replacement

Let's round off for today with an impressive demonstration of the importance of an audio track complementing a video experience.

My son [Christopher](http://tammik.ca) studied sound design at the [Vancouver Film School](http://vfs.edu/programs/sound-design) last year.

He then launched his career as an independent computer game sound designer, only to veer off into a more programming oriented direction once he realised that the most efficient approach to accomplishing his goals would require his to implement his own tools in the Unity gaming engine first anyway.

Anyway, back to the VFS:

For his final exam, Chris picked a five-minute video equipped with a sound track and implemented a full sound replacement for it.

This involves music, a cast of voice characters, background sound replacement, synchronisation, etc. It is a bit harder than you might initially imagine &nbsp; :-)

Here is the original video and the full sound replacement version side by side:

For the sake of completeness, yet another version exists as well, [Endtrip Rescored by Sergio Ramis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjLWsTdISfY).

I found the comparison utterly fascinating; maybe you will too?
