<h3>Type Catalogues and FireRating in the Cloud</h3>

<p>Let's veer away from the Revit API for a moment and take a look at family type catalogues, since questions on those pop up regularly in connection with programming as well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Programmatic type catalogue creation</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Tweaking type catalogue behaviour</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Type catalogue parameters</a></li>

<h4>Programmatic Type Catalogue Creation</h4>

<!-- 10647769 [API support for creating type catalog (GK)] -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong>

Is there any API support (function) to create type catalogues?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>

As far as I know, there are two ways to create type catalogues, and both are programmatically accessible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a TXT file associated with the family listing the possible combinations of dimensioning parameters.</li>

<li>Create an MEP specific type catalogue for MEP parts.</li>
</ul>

<p>I assume you are interested in the latter?</p>

<p>I tried searching the Revit API help for 'catalog', and that does indeed not return any relevant results.</p>

<p>However, searching the various
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2016-api.html">What's New in the Revit API</a> overviews,
I found the following
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/whats-new-in-the-revit-2014-api.html">
for Revit 2014</a>:</p>

<h4>CSV Fitting Parameter Removal</h4>

<p>Because CSV files are no longer used to drive MEP fitting parameters, Revit supports a new set of APIs to manage fitting parameters through several classes:</p>

<ul>
<li>FamilySizeTableManager &ndash; manages importing and exporting of legacy CSV data and size tables.</li>
<li>FamilySizeTable &ndash; manages specific sizes of fittings.</li>
<li>FamilySizeTableColumn &ndash; manages a specific dimension of a given size in a size table</li>
<li>FamilySizeTableErrorInfo &ndash; reports any errors when importing an file with CSV size table into a FamilySizeTable</li>
</ul>
</span>

<p>Is this possibly what you are looking for?</p>

<p>So maybe what you are after is the FamilySizeTable class and all its associated methods and properties.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong>

Actually we are interested in the first item, creating a TXT file associated with the family listing the possible combinations of dimensioning parameters.</p>

<p>Is there a way to create this txt file using Revit API?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>

That case is quite trivial, as far as I know:</p>

<p>Simply create a TXT file with the same name as the family definition RFA, and it will be picked up automatically by Revit.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any specific Revit API to achieve this or support it in any way.</p>

<p>To create the file, you can use standard .NET functionality, or anything else you like.</p>

<p>Basically this approach is simply making use of the standard family definition user interface functionality.</p>

<h4>Tweaking Type Catalogue Behaviour</h4>

<!-- 1257060 [Family Type Catalog] -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong>

Is there any support for TXT family type catalogue files inside Revit API? </p>

<p>If I use one of the LoadFamily methods and there is a TXT file along with the RFA, will the type selection dialogue pop up automatically? </p>

<p>Is there any way to tweak or suppress this behaviour?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>

While there isn't any support to handle the family type catalogue TXT files using the API, I was wondering if, instead of using LoadFamily, using LoadFamilySymbol to load up the specific symbols would work for you.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can also load any single type from the family, programmatically duplicate it and modify the new type's parameters as you like.</p>

<h4>Type Catalogue Parameters</h4>

<!-- 10915457 [Type catalog questions - Follow up for case 10647769 (GK)] -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong>

I have three questions related to type catalogues:</p>

<ol>
<li>The type catalogues created by Revit (using the UI button) have on the first line parameter names plus some extra information, e.g., <code>Type##OTHER##</code> or <code>Thickness##LENGTH##MILLIMETERS</code>.
What is the logic how that extra information is added and from where?</li>

<li>When I look at the family parameters accessible from the family manager, I see some that are not present in the type catalogue. How do we know which parameters are and are not written to the type catalogue?</li>

<li>Is there a validation mechanism for a type catalogue? How to check if is valid or not?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>

This information is about standard end user content creation and not at all Revit API related.</p>

<p>Therefore, you can probably find the answers yourself by researching those topics from an end user point of view.</p>

<p>One place to start is obviously the related
<a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2015/ENU/?guid=GUID-FFA71D72-D4C5-416D-BF65-1757657C3CE9">
documentation on type catalogues and their syntax</a> &ndash; by the way, interestingly enough, the same help id also applies for
<a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVTLT/2016/ENU/?guid=GUID-FFA71D72-D4C5-416D-BF65-1757657C3CE9">LT</a>.</p>

<p>I think this should help with your issues #1 and #2.</p>

<p>Regarding #3: it is indeed possible to create a poorly defined type catalogue.</p>

<p>That will get some sort of warning or error when you try to load such a family.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any other way to check or validate via API or otherwise.</p>

<p>Loading a family with a type catalog displays the dialogue 'Specify Types':</p>
<center>
<img src="img/specify_types.png" alt="Specify Types" width="589"/>
</center>
<p>The grid under the types section is driven directly from the type catalog.
If the type catalog includes additional parameters that are not in the family, a warning is displayed and they are ignored.</p>

<h4>Type Catalogue Units</h4>

<!-- 1259665 [Type Catalog Power units] -->

<p><strong>Question:</strong>

we're trying to create type catalogue in txt file for Radiator family. We were trying to define a parameter in watt units, with no success. How to define header for this parameter?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>

Look at page 15 of Martin Schmid's Autodesk University
<a zip="zip/ME318-1L_Creating_Revit_MEP_Content_for_Engineering_Coordination.pdf">
class handout</a> on <i>Creating Revit MEP Content for Engineering Coordination</i>.</p>

<p>Here is a sample Exhaust Fan <a href="zip/Exhaust_Fan.rfa">RFA</a> and <a href="zip/Exhaust_Fan.txt">TXT</a> file for you to play with.</p>

<p>They don't use Watts, but should give the idea if you are not already familiar with type catalogues.</p>

<p>Also, the families guide provides a list of the parameter types, namely, for electrical_power: watts, kilowatts, british_thermal_units_per_second, british_thermal_units_per_hour, calories_per_second, kilocalories_per_second, volt_amperes, kilovolt_amperes, horsepower.</p>

<p>Thus, the header definition for such a parameter would be:</p>

<pre>
[paramname]##electrical_power##watts
</pre>
