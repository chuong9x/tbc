BCF API and manual add-in setup #revitAPI #3dwebcoder @AutodeskRevit @openbimstandard @BuildingSMARTUK #bim

The time is overdue to migrate the Visual Studio Revit Add-In Wizards to Revit 2017.
This time, instead of a simple flat migration like in previous years, I decided to set up a new Visual Studio C# .NET Revit add-in project manually, by hand, completely from scratch, just to see whether anything significant changed since I did that last, and to ensure that the wizard is really using all the required Visual Studio settings.
I tried it out in by implementing a buildingSMART BCF API sample client.
Basically, that requires the following steps
&ndash; Create a new pure Visual Studio class library
&ndash; Rename Class1 to Command
&ndash; Add references to the Revit API assemblies
&ndash; Implement an external command
&ndash; Implement an add-in manifest
&ndash; Define an add-in GUID
&ndash; Implement a post-build event to auto-install the add-in...

<h3>BCF API and Manually Setting Up an Add-In</h3>
<p>The time is overdue to migrate
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.20">Visual Studio Revit Add-In Wizards</a> to
Revit 2017.</p>

<p>Basically, that requires the following steps:</p>

<li>Create a new pure Visual Studio class library</li>
<li>Rename <code>Class1</code> to <code>Command</code></li>
<li>Add references to the Revit API assemblies</li>

<h4><a name="2"></a>The BCF API and a Sample Client</h4>
<p>To try out these steps, I made use of a brand new sample project that I implemented in response to
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread inquiring
about <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/support-for-bcf-api/m-p/6282780">support for the BCF API</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Can anyone answer if Revit supports the BCF API to allow for third party integrations?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I searched the Internet for 'bcf api' and found
the <a href="https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-API">BuildingSMART BCF-API GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Is that what you are talking about?</p>
<p>Being a REST API, you can use it perfectly well from your own .NET add-ins.</p>
<p>The BCF API GitHub repo points to a C# client,
the <a href="https://github.com/rvestvik/BcfApiExampleClient">BcfApiExampleClient</a>.</p>
<p>You can try integrating that very code into a Revit add-in and see how it goes.</p>
<p>Out of interest, I took a slightly deeper look.</p>
<p>I see that BCF stands for <a href="http://iug.buildingsmart.org/resources/abu-dhabi-iug-meeting/IDMC_017_1.pdf">BIM Collaboration Format</a>.</p>
<p>I also see that the C# sample can easily be integrated into a Revit add-in.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does the Revit API create the JSON for BCF or would we be required to create it ourselves via the add-in?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I was not aware of BCF until you raised this question, and I am pretty sure that Revit does nothing to support it.</p>
<p>If it is BCF specific, you will probably have to create it with your own custom add-in.</p>
<p>I created a new project to try out converting the BcfApiExampleClient sample to a Revit add-in,
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient">RvtBcfApiExampleClient</a>.</p>
<p>It is a pure and simple REST API client.</p>
<p>I had some issues getting both the original sample and my Revit version up and running.</p>
<p>They were resolved over the week-end, however, and both the stand-alone sample client and the new Revit add-in version now work fine.</p>
<p>The first step is the log in to the BIM-IT server:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/BcfApiExampleClient_login_bim_it.png" alt="BIM-IT login" width="467">
</center></p>
<p>As usual, this authorisation process returns an access token:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/BcfApiExampleClient_authorisation.png" alt="BIM-IT access token" width="379">
</center></p>
<p>Finally, the sample simply lists all existing projects, of which I possess exactly zero:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/BcfApiExampleClient_project_list.png" alt="BIM-IT project list" width="366">
</center></p>
<p>If you are interested in diving deeper into the BCF API, please note
the <a href="https://github.com/rvestvik/BcfApiExampleClient/issues/2">comment by Georg Dangl</a>,
saying, "in December we had another Hackathon in Munich where Veni Lillkall created
a <a href="https://github.com/BIMit/BCF-Hackathon-Munich/tree/Team_C%23">small sample app in C#</a>.
That might give you some ideas how to use the BCF API itself."</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Manual Setup of a Revit Add-In</h4>
<p>As said, I used the BCF API client sample project to record exactly how to manually set up a Visual Studio C# .NET Revit add-in from scratch.</p>
<p>Here are the detailed individual steps I performed for this, with links to the corresponding commits in the GitHub repository:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/7fb713de0efb0940191ba20dba7b7b08220c7e62">Added pure Visual Studio class library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/4a98cd78157be9e36abda9b9b85a3156d8fed911">Renamed Class1 to Command and edited properties</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/ccd0c0f6469425c059567e3b26b75acbc37602b2">Added Revit API assemblies and implemented external command</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/1f9f74e83af6cdbbea4541ab03cdbe15a6868754">Added add-in manifest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/667a7d8b51292ae3a84bbf59df8d7d2ad9a64886">Added add-in manifest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/4982403505a9baf44e46e36cf5b500d3375af7b9">Added GUID using guidize.exe</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/9101faa26d071d6247714c6f4af94171a9814f52">Implemented post-build event to auto-install add-in for Revit to find</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/commit/1912b9586bcb2ec0219f89bc0fc4d8aa98992bd9">Successfully tested</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The result is <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/releases/tag/2017.0.0.0">RvtBcfApiExampleClient release 2017.0.0.0</a>, which is just a naked Revit 2017 C# .NET add-in skeleton.</p>
<p>The final working version presented above after fixing the initial problems with the login process is captured
in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtBcfApiExampleClient/releases/tag/2017.0.0.4">release 2017.0.0.4</a>.</p>
<p>As said, next I will use the generated files to update
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.20">Visual Studio Revit add-in wizard</a> for Revit 2017.</p>
