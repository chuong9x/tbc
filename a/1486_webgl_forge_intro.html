<h3>Forge Formats, Webinars and Fusion 360 Client API</h3>
<p>I updated
the <a href="http://jeremytammik.github.io/forge_bim_programming">WebGL and Forge introduction for BIM programming</a> and
its <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/forge_bim_programming">GitHub source</a> for
the presentations in the coming days at 
the <a href="http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2016eur">RTC Revit Technology Conference Europe</a> and 
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ISEPBIM">ISEPBIM</a> Forge and BIM workshops at <a href="http://www.isep.ipp.pt">ISEP</a>, 
the <a href="http://www.isep.ipp.pt">Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto</a>,
implemented two little <code>curl</code> wrapper scripts to help me list the supported file formats, explored why they changed and updated the hackathon webinar overview.</p>
<p>Before getting to that, though, I'll also highlight a helpful little note by Christian on how to access the 'Symbolic Representation' setting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#1">'Symbolic Representation' setting parameter</a></li>
<li><a href="#2">Forge intro for BIM programming</a></li>
<li><a href="#3"><code>cURL</code> wrapper scripts to list Forge file formats</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Updated Forge file formats</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">Forge hackathon webinar series and Fusion 360 Client API recording</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="1"></a>'Symbolic Representation' Setting Parameter</h4>
<p>Christian shared how to access the 'Symbolic Representation' setting in a family definition in 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/symbolic-representation-parameter/m-p/6623135">symbolic representation - parameter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>just wanted to share some code as I "lost" one hour of my life to look for it. If you want to access the setting for "Symbolic Representation" inside a family document, here we go:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Parameter</span>&nbsp;param&nbsp;=&nbsp;famdoc.OwnerFamily.get_Parameter(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BuiltInParameter</span>.FAMILY_SYMBOLIC_REP&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>(&nbsp;param&nbsp;!=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>&nbsp;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;0&nbsp;-&nbsp;From&nbsp;Family&nbsp;</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;param.Set(&nbsp;1&nbsp;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre>

<p>Thank you very much for sharing that, Christian!</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Forge Intro for BIM Programming</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/forge_bim_programming">Forge for BIM Programming</a> is
a <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js">reveal.js</a> presentation
on <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl">WebGL</a>
and <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">Autodesk Forge platform</a> introduction.</p>
<p>It was first used for
the <a href="http://www.bimprogramming.com">BIM Programming</a> conference
and workshops in Madrid, January 2016, and now updated for 
the <a href="http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2016eur">RTC Revit Technology Conference Europe</a> and 
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ISEPBIM">ISEPBIM</a> Forge and BIM workshops at <a href="http://www.isep.ipp.pt">ISEP</a>,

<h4><a name="3"></a><code>cURL</code> Wrapper Scripts to List Forge File Formats</h4>
<p>One of the slides in the presentation above lists the file formats currently supported by the Forge platform.</p>
<p>This list can be obtained by a REST call to
the <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/">Forge</a>
<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/">Model Derivative API</a>
<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/formats-GET/">GET formats</a> endpoint:</p>
<p><font color="darkblue"></p>
<p>I had an temporarily insurmountable problem with Typepad crashing at this point... it was resolved by escaping the character <code>c</code> using <code>&amp;#99;</code> in all calls to the <code>curl</code> command in the following scripts, i.e., replacing the string <code>curl</code> by <code>&amp;#99;url</code>. Weird, probably protects against some potential hack, and now solved...</p>
<p>You can look at what I actually intend to publish in
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc">tbc GitHub repository</a>,
where this blog posts is mirrored
as <a href="http://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a/1486_webgl_forge_intro.html">tbc/a/1486_webgl_forge_intro.html</a>.</p>
<p>Sorry, I am unable to add the scripts inline to this typepad post.</p>
<p>Here they are as links instead:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="zip/forgeauth">forgeauth</a></li>
<li><a href="zip/forgeformats">forgeformats</a></li>
</ul>
<p>OK, back to normal now, problem resolved...</p>
<p></font></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&#99;url -X 'GET' -H 'Authorization: Bearer ztcaB2R0f92bsV6iV0bSDgwmSVaW' -v 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/designdata/formats'
</pre>

<p>We need to supply a valid access token, though, instead of the placeholder listed above.</p>
<p>This in turn is obtained by a call to
the <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/">authentication</a>
<a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/reference/http/authenticate-POST/">POST authenticate</a> endpoint,
specifying our client id and secret.</p>
<p>To easily complete this two-step process from the command line, I implemented two Unix shell scripts, <code>forgeauth</code> and <code>forgeformats</code>.</p>
<p>The former retrieves my client id and secret from two environment variables and calls the <code>authenticate</code> endpoint like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash

&#99;url -v 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/authenticate' -X 'POST' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d "client_id=$ROOMEDIT3DV3_PROD_CONSUMER_KEY&client_secret=$ROOMEDIT3DV3_PROD_CONSUMER_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials&scope=data:read"

echo "Now you might want to export FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=... for consumption by forgeformats"
</pre>

<p>This returns the following JSON formatted access token data:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{"access_token":"XzVxWJoVbNWcnJeKJPRnkYjp1tgt","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":86399}
</pre>

<p>As the script suggests, I store the transient access token in another environment variable <code>FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ export FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=XzVxWJoVbNWcnJeKJPRnkYjp1tgt
</pre>

<p>From there, it is retrieved by the second script, <code>forgeformats</code>, which feeds it into the second endpoint like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash
&#99;url -X 'GET' -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot; -v 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/designdata/formats'
</pre>

<p>Right now, that returns the following list:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
{"formats":{"svf":["3dm","3ds","asm","catpart","catproduct","cgr","collaboration","dae","dgn","dlv3","dwf","dwfx","dwg","dwt","dxf","exp","f3d","fbx","g","gbxml","iam","idw","ifc","ige","iges","igs","ipt","jt","model","neu","nwc","nwd","obj","pdf","prt","rcp","rvt","sab","sat","session","skp","sldasm","sldprt","smb","smt","ste","step","stl","stla","stlb","stp","stpz","wire","x_b","x_t","xas","xpr","zip","prt\\.\\d+$","neu\\.\\d+$","asm\\.\\d+$"],"thumbnail":["3dm","3ds","asm","catpart","catproduct","cgr","collaboration","dae","dgn","dlv3","dwf","dwfx","dwg","dwt","dxf","exp","f3d","fbx","g","gbxml","iam","idw","ifc","ige","iges","igs","ipt","jt","model","neu","nwc","nwd","obj","pdf","prt","rcp","rvt","sab","sat","session","skp","sldasm","sldprt","smb","smt","ste","step","stl","stla","stlb","stp","stpz","wire","x_b","x_t","xas","xpr","zip","prt\\.\\d+$","neu\\.\\d+$","asm\\.\\d+$"],"stl":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","wire"],"step":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","wire"],"iges":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","wire"],"obj":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","step","stp","stpz","wire"]}}
</pre>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Updated Forge file formats</h4>
<p>Here is the list of extensions currently returned by call to the <code>formats</code> endpoint shown above, cleaned up and alphabetically sorted:</p>
<ul>
<li>3dm, 3ds, asm, asm, catpart, catproduct, cgr, collaboration, dae, dgn, dlv3, dwf, dwfx, dwg, dwt, dxf, exp, f3d, fbx, g, gbxml, iam, idw, ifc, ige, iges, igs, ipt, jt, model, neu, neu, nwc, nwd, obj, pdf, prt, prt, rcp, rvt, sab, sat, session, skp, sldasm, sldprt, smb, smt, ste, step, stl, stla, stlb, stp, stpz, wire, x_b, x_t, xas, xpr, zip</li>
</ul>
<p>I compared that with <a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/displaying-2d-graphics-via-a-node-server.html#3.1">the previous list that I generated in January</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>3dm, 3ds, asm, bmp, cam360, catpart, catproduct, cgr, csv, dae, dlv3, doc, docx, dwf, dwfx, dwg, dwt, exp, f3d, fbx, g, gbxml, iam, ifc, ige, iges, igs, ipt, jpeg, jpg, jt, model, neu, nwc, nwd, obj, pdf, png, pps, ppt, pptx, prt, rcp, rtf, rvt, sab, sat, session, sim, sim360, skp, sldasm, sldprt, smb, smt, ste, step, stl, stla, stlb, stp, tif, tiff, txt, wire, x_b, x_t, xas, xls, xlsx, xpr, zip</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, support for quite a number of new formats has been added.</p>
<p>A few have also been removed, such as BMP and TIFF.</p>
<p>I asked for an explanation for that, and learned the following:</p>
<p>Here are the ones that seem to have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>collaboration, dgn, dxf, idw, stpz</li>
</ul>
<p>We assume it was easy (and made sense) to extend to more CAD-related formats such as <code>dgn</code>, <code>dxf</code> and <code>idw</code>.</p>
<p><code>Stpz</code> is probably just compressed STP, so that was presumably a no-brainer, too.</p>
<p>The following have been removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>bmp, cam360, csv, doc, docx, jpeg, jpg, png, pps, ppt, pptx, rtf, sim, sim360, tif, tiff, txt, xls, xlsx</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from <code>cam360</code>, <code>sim</code> and <code>sim360</code>, these are all Office or image formats.</p>
<p>Some were not actually supported by the Model Derivative service but are supported in the A360 product and its viewers.</p>
<p>This looks like good progress, to me.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Adam, Kean and Lee for their analysis, suggestions and clarifications!</p>
