<h3>DevDays Online and Add-In Migration</h3>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Add-In Migration &ndash; Update API references</h4>
<p>Eric Boehlke of <a href="https://truevis.com">truevis</a> BIM Consulting
wrote a blog post about how to upgrade a Revit API add-in to a version of Revit.</p>
<p>Says he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may already have done this thousands of times.
One of the reasons to write these posts is to remember for myself how to do such things a year from now.
Hence:
<a href="http://revthat.com/upgrading-revit-api-apps-for-newer-revit-versions">Upgrading Revit API Apps For Newer Revit Versions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/ypC_0REg22U">75-second video</a> reiterating the same instructions to make a dry subject more fun:</p>
<p><center>
<iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypC_0REg22U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center></p>
<p>The cautionary message on not confusing <code>RevitAPIUI.dll</code> and <code>RevitUIAPI.dll</code> is due to personally running into that issue once.</p>
<p>Removing the existing Revit API references, adding the new ones, and setting <code>Copy Local</code> to <code>false</code> is the foolproof way to upgrade.</p>
<p>In many cases, though, you can do this all in one single step by just adding the new references.</p>
<p>This overwrites the old references and retains the <code>Copy Local</code> <code>false</code> setting.</p>
<p>However, that is an unimportant detail.</p>
<p>It's not actually much effort to create such a video from a blog post.
<a href="https://lumen5.com">lumen5.com</a> makes an initial "AI" attempt at turning my blog posts into videos.
Then I just refine it. It takes 10 or 15 minutes.
They say: "We automatically create Instant Videos for you based on your RSS feeds. "</p>
<p>Here's another one of Eric's videos,
on <a href="https://youtu.be/UZl9gpFgxy0">how to get coordinates of an existing Revit View, then use them for placing other Views in Dynamo</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="2.1"></a>Addendum &ndash; NuGet Package and .NET Framework Version</h4>
<p>Jason Masters adds some important notes to this in
his <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/01/devdays-online-and-add-in-migration.html#comment-4774664575">comment below</a>:</p>
<p>In terms of upgrading Revit API versions, I'd highly recommend switching from references to the SDK to referencing
the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Revit_All_Main_Versions_API_x64">NuGet package published by Matthew Taylor (Revit_All_Main_Versions_API_x64)</a>:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/revit_all_main_versions_api.jpg" alt="NuGet package Revit all main versions API" title="NuGet package Revit all main versions API" width="512"/> <!-- 2365 -->
</center></p>
<p>This package contains all the Revit API references across all versions.
Using NuGet means that any other developer opening your repo won't necessarily need the SDK to build it, it will integrate more easily into CI/CD pipelines, and checking against different API versions is as simple as changing which version of the NuGet package you're using.</p>
<p>Also, if you need to migrate to 2020, you're going to need to first change the .NET target framework version of your project to 4.7, then update your references to the 2020 API.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Jason for these important notes!</p>
