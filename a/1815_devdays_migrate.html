<h3>DevDays Online and Add-In Migration</h3>
<p>I share a contribution from fellow blogger Eric Boehlke and the announcement of the upcoming yearly DevDays Online presentations:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>Add-In Migration &ndash; Update API references</h4>
<p>Eric Boehlke of <a href="https://truevis.com">truevis</a> BIM Consulting
wrote a blog post about how to upgrade a Revit API add-in to a version of Revit.</p>
<p>Says he:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may already have done this thousands of times.
One of the reasons to write these posts is to remember for myself how to do such things a year from now.
Hence:

</blockquote>
<p>Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/ypC_0REg22U">75-second video</a> reiterating the same instructions to make a dry subject more fun:</p>

</center></p>
<p>The cautionary message on not confusing <code>RevitAPIUI.dll</code> and <code>RevitUIAPI.dll</code> is due to personally running into that issue once.</p>
<p>Removing the existing Revit API references, adding the new ones, and setting <code>Copy Local</code> to <code>false</code> is the foolproof way to upgrade.</p>
<p>In many cases, though, you can do this all in one single step by just adding the new references.</p>
<p>This overwrites the old references and retains the <code>Copy Local</code> <code>false</code> setting.</p>
<p>However, that is an unimportant detail.</p>
<p>It's not actually much effort to create such a video from a blog post.
<a href="https://lumen5.com">lumen5.com</a> makes an initial "AI" attempt at turning my blog posts into videos.
Then I just refine it. It takes 10 or 15 minutes.
They say: "We automatically create Instant Videos for you based on your RSS feeds. "</p>
<p>Here's another one of Eric's videos,
on <a href="https://youtu.be/UZl9gpFgxy0">how to get coordinates of an existing Revit View, then use them for placing other Views in Dynamo</a>.</p>
