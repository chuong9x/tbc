<h3>TextNote Lost in Space?</h3>

<p>Here is the result of another interesting discussion I had with Rudolf Honke of

<a href="http://www.acadgraph.de">
Mensch und Maschine acadGraph GmbH</a>. 

<p>We already looked at some aspects of text formatting such as 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/revitlookup-and-textnote-alignment.html">
alignment</a>,

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/textnote-rotation.html">
rotation</a> and

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/text-size.html">
size</a> in 

the past.

<p>So whilst there are some manipulations we can perform on text notes, it is rather irking that their Location property is not accessible.

<p>Seen through the API, the Location property value is always either a LocationPoint or LocationCurve instance.
I assume that neither of these two fit the internal location data structure of a text note position, and therefore its location is simply not exposed at all by the API.
Very sad.

<p>As Rudolf pointed out, however, the TextNote provides a Coord property instead.

<p>You can retrieve the X and Y coordinates of a TextNote element from its Coord property.

<p>The Z value of the Coord property is sometimes valid, e.g. for a text note in a section view, and sometimes not, e.g. in plan view, where it is zero, in all cases we have seen so far.

<p>These coordinate values are 'model space' coordinates, i.e. they really represent the text note location in 3D space.

<p>As said, the Coord.Z property depends on the view type.
In a floor plan, the correct Z value may be obtained via the GenLevel.Elevation property.
The Z behaviour for other 2D view types such as drafting, detail and area plan is still unknown  :-)

<p>I also noticed that room tags in plan views have invalid Z coordinate values.
They have a valid Location property, but like the TextNote.Coord, the Z coordinate is zero.
I observe this on all my RoomTags, independent of the RoomTag.Room.Level.

<p>So the position of several different kinds of text objects seems to be a mixture of 2D and 3D if they belong to plan views.

<p>One hypothesis is that the 'zero Z in plan view' behaviour is shared by all types derived from SpatialElementTag, i.e. area, room and space tags.

<p>No guarantees on any of this information, but it might a least provide some additional understanding and a starting point to locate your text note elements.

<p>Thank you Rudolf for raising this issue and pointing out the workaround!
