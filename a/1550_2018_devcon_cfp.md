### RevitLookup 2018 and Forge DevCon CFP

Revit 2018 has been released.

The Revit 2018 SDK (Software Developers Kit) is available from
the [Revit Developer Centre](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit).

I migrated [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup)
and [The Building Coder samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples).

Finally, the call for proposals has opened for the Forge DevCon at Autodesk University in Las Vegas:

- [RevitLookup 2018](#3)
- [The Building Coder samples 2018](#4)
- [Forge DevCon call for proposals](#5)


#### <a name="2"></a>Revit 2018 Software Developers Kit

Revit 2018 has been released and the Revit 2018 SDK is available from
the [Revit Developer Centre](http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit).

First of all, you might want to check out
the [overview of new product features](http://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-family/features) and
check how they correlate with the API functionality enhancements discussed in
the [DevDays Online API news](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/03/revitlookup-enhancements-future-revit-and-other-api-news.html).

The Revit SDK contains documentation and samples, which I unpacked in my local folder `C:\a\lib\revit\2018\SDK`:

- Subdirectories:
    - Add-In Manager
    - Macro Samples
    - Revit Server SDK
    - Revit Structure
    - REX SDK
    - Samples
    - Structural Analysis SDK
- Documents:
    - Autodesk Icon Guidelines.pdf
    - Getting Started with the Revit API.docx
    - Read Me First.doc
    - Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx
    - RevitAddInUtility.chm
    - RevitAPI.chm
    - RevitAPISDK_Eula.rtf

The most important things to install and always keep at hand are:

- The Revit API help file `RevitAPI.chm`
- The Visual Studio solution containing all the SDK samples, `Samples\SDKSamples.sln`

You will need these constantly for research on how to solve specific Revit API programming tasks.

Another main source of more in-depth official information is provided by 
the [developer guide](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2018/ENU/?guid=GUID-F0A122E0-E556-4D0D-9D0F-7E72A9315A42) in
the [online help](http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2018/ENU/).

Obviously, while migrating your existing samples, the first place to consult in case of problems is the list of *Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx*.

It is also included as a separate section in the help file.


#### <a name="3"></a>RevitLookup 2018

After installing Revit 2018, the first thing I did was to update and
recompile [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup).

The flat migration with no significant changes produced
the [release 2018.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2018.0.0.0).

That was rather easy!


#### <a name="4"></a>The Building Coder Samples 2018

Next, I turned to something more complex,
[The Building Coder samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples).

The flat migration from Revit 2017 to Revit 2018 initially caused several compilation errors.

I fixed those with the
following [GitHub commits](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/commits/master):

- updated Revit API references to Revit 2018
- replaced old `Autodesk.Revit.Utility` namespace by new `Autodesk.Revit.DB.Visual`
- added `RevitAPIUIMacros.dll`
- `Ellipse.Create` renamed to `Ellipse.CreateCurve`
- `Ellipse.CreateCurve` returns a curve not an ellipse
- `RevitLinkLoadResult` was renamed to `LinkLoadResult`

After that, compilation completed successfully with zero errors.

Seven warnings about deprecated API usage remained:

- CmdAzimuth.cs(104,13,104,53): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.get_ProjectPosition(XYZ)` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetProjectPosition` instead.
- CmdUnrotateNorth.cs(48,33,48,61): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.SiteLocation` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetSiteLocation` instead.
- CmdUnrotateNorth.cs(79,33,79,61): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.SiteLocation` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetSiteLocation` instead.
- CmdUnrotateNorth.cs(163,17,163,57): warning CS0618: `ProjectLocation.get_ProjectPosition(XYZ)` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `ProjectLocation.GetProjectPosition` instead.
- CmdSetTagType.cs(226,30,228,48): warning CS0618: `Document.NewTag(View, Element, bool, TagMode, TagOrientation, XYZ)` is obsolete: This method is deprecated in Revit 2018 and will be removed in a future version. Use `IndependentTag.Create` instead.
- CmdGetMaterials.cs(248,48,248,62): warning CS0618: `AssetPropertyDoubleArray3d.Value` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `getValueAsDoubles` or `getValueAsXYZ` instead.
- CmdGetMaterials.cs(254,48,254,62): warning CS0618: `AssetPropertyDoubleArray4d.Value` is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2018. Use `getValueAsDoubles` instead.

I captured this state in [The Building Coder sample release 2018.0.132.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2018.0.132.0).

Later, I fixed the trivial warnings:

- `get_ProjectPosition` renamed to `GetProjectPosition`
- replaced `ProjectLocation` `SiteLocation` property by `GetSiteLocation` method
 
These fixes have been applied in [release 2018.0.132.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2018.0.132.1).

Three warnings remain to be sorted out, listed
in [my migration notes](zip/tbc_samples_2018_migr_01.txt).

The asset related ones are explained in the section on *Asset API Changes* in the *changes and additions* document mentioned above.

Good luck with your own add-in migrations!

Meanwhile, looking a bit further ahead:
