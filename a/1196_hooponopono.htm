<h3>Striving for Personal Peace Continued</h3>

<p>Yesterday, I spent a day with a group of seven friends to talk and share our everyday issues based on the principles of

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">non-violent communication</a>,

sharing and council.</p>

<p>Now, after almost two years of meeting regularly like this, we have grown pretty close and know each other quite well, causing inter-personal conflicts at new and more subtle levels.</p>

<p>We spontaneously created and shared a healing ritual based on the Hawaiian

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho%CA%BBoponopono">Ho'oponopono</a> practice

of reconciliation and forgiveness.</p>

<p>This provides a very nice and personal continuation on my reflections last Friday on

letting go of suffering and striving for peace</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Es tut mir leid
<br/>Bitte vergib mir
<br/>Ich danke dir
<br/>Ich liebe dich</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I am sorry
<br/>Please forgive me
<br/>I thank you
<br/>I love you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We sang this chant together for an extended period of time, beginning with eyes closed, gradually opening them and looking into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>We were all surprised about the deep, touching and powerful healing feelings and connection that ensued.</p>

<p>It does indeed feel as if we are furthering peace in the world.</p>

<p>I wish you a happy, connected and peaceful Sunday.</p>
