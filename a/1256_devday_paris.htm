<h3>DevDays Conference and Meetup in Paris</h3>

<p>I left Autodesk University, Las Vegas, and travelled to Paris via London.</p>

<h4>DevDay and Meetup</h4>

<p>Today, we held the first West European

<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/devdays2014">
DevDays</a> conference

here, followed by a meetup on reality capture, 3D on the web and 3D printing in the

Ecole des ingenieurs de la Ville de Paris</a> (<a href="http://www.eivp-paris.fr">eivp-paris.fr</a>).</p>

<p>From here, we continue to

<a href="file:///a/doc/revit/blog/1199_devdays_hack_calendar.htm#2">London, Gothenburg, Munich and Milano</a> during the coming ten days.</p>

<h4>Jasper</h4>

<p>Unexpectedly, I got to meet Jasper Desmet, whom I previously only knew by email.
Last year, he presented his

space adjacency for heat load calculation</a> here

on The Building Coder.
He is now studying at

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)">
ecole 42</a> (<a href="http://www.42.fr">42.fr</a>),

an exciting programming school inspired by new modern learning methods including peer-to-peer pedagogy, adding some programming experience to his construction engineering knowledge to create interesting opportunities in CAD.</p>

<h4>Vélib'</h4>

<p>Once again &ndash; like a couple of years ago, in

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/filtered-element-collector-sample-overview.html">December 2010</a> &ndash;

I have been making extensive use of the wonderful Parisian

<h4>Aaron Lu's New Posts</h4>

<p>While I was underway at Autodesk University and getting here, my new colleague

<a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/aaron-lu.html">Aaron Lu</a> in China has been very productive, publishing 12 articles on the Chinese blog and 3 on the international AEC DevBlog:</p>

<h4>Round Window Opening Geometry &ndash; Or Not</h4>

<p>Pretty obvious, once you think about it: if an element has no solid geometry of its own, you cannot retrieve any solid for it:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a round window opening in a wall like this:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/get_round_window_geometry.jpg" alt="Round window opening" width="300"/>
</center>

<p>However, I am unable to obtain any geometry information from this family instance and the round shape window symbol.
I was able to retrieve their solids, but they have are no faces or edges.
You can also see it using RevitLookup and the ElementViewer SDK sample.</p>

<p>Is there any way to get the geometry information for these round shaped windows?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There should be no trouble reading the geometry of this type of window.
It will either contain solids or a GeometryInstance or both.
If you only find empty solids, please provide the sample model for us to explore.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> I explored this window opening with the ElementViewer sample and it still seems to have an empty solid.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ahaaa... this window is just a cut-out &ndash; there is no glass or other substance here.
Therefore, the family instance does not have any own geometry, just a void.
The only way to determine the shape of the void is to look at what it does to its host.</p>

<h4>DuckDuckGo</h4>

<p>By the way, talking about searching for answers...</p>

<p>My son recommended that I boycott Google and start using the

<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a> search engine instead.</p>

<p>They guarantee not to track your information (or any information whatsoever, for that matter), provide more transparent search algorithms, are completely open source and

<a href="http://duckduckhack.com">
easily extensible</a>.</p>

<p>So far, I like it very much!</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we'll take off for the next venue in good old Blighty.</p>
