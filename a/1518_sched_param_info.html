<h3>Retrieving Schedule Parameter Information</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2"></a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>The "ScheduleField" class has a property "ParameterId", which is good.</p>
<p>Now I would like to know more about the this parameter:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the parameter,</li>
<li>If it is an instance or type parameter,</li>
<li>If it is a shared or built-in parameter,</li>
<li>The parameter Unit,</li>
<li>GUID of the parameter if it is shared.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think I can get 1 and 2 working, but pretty much clueless about 3, 4 and 5.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Before anything else, I must ask you:</p>
<p>Have you installed <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a> and are you using it on a regular basis in your Revit database exploration?</p>
<p>If the answer is 'no', I suggest we terminate this discussion right here and now until you have installed it and tested using it for your situation:</p>
<p>With that tool, you can interactively snoop the database.</p>
<p>In this case, you could grab one of those ParameterId values, use the Revit API Manage tab to select the corresponding database element, regardless of whether it has a graphical representation or not, and interactively explore its nature, contents, parameters, relationships with other elements, etc.</p>
<p>That will probably answer your question right then and there.</p>
<p>It is statically compiled, however, so it mainly displays properties. It does not dynamically evaluate all methods available on all classes.</p>
<p>For that, you can use other,
even <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html">more powerful and interactive database exploration tools</a>.</p>
<p>Also, my discussion
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/01/virtues-of-reproduction-research-mep-settings-ontology.html#3">How to Research to Find a Revit API Solution</a> might
come in handy for you at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>
<p>I have installed RevitLookup for Revit 2015 (the version I'm developing as our development needs to be backward compatible with our current projects).</p>
<p>RevitLookup is a great tool that can save hundreds hours of time on browsing the "watch" in the debug mode, which I have been using.</p>
<p>However, I still can't find the field parameter definitions (shared or builtin) for the "schedulefield" class. I understand the "viewschedule" and "schedulefield" are different classes. I suspect this may have to do with Revit API's limitation.</p>
<p>By the way it seems RevitLookup is a ribbon panel in the "Add-ins" tab, I can't see "API Manage Tab", am I missing something here?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>1  Name =  Field.GetName()</p>
<p>2  Type or Instance?  Probably only a definitive answer for a schedule of 1 System Family Category. Shared Parameters in User Created Families can be both Type and Instance ( in different families)</p>
<p>3  Shared or BuiltIn? 
Field.ParameterId &lt; -1 : BuiltInParameter     Field.ParameterId == BuiltInParameter value
Field.ParameterId &gt;0:    SharedParameter
Field.ParameterId = -1: miscellaneous ( calculated value, percentage)
Shared Parameter:
SharedParameterElement shElem = doc.GetElement(Field.ParameterId) as SharedParameterElement
You can find the answer to 4 and 5 in shElem.Definition </p>
<p>BuiltParameter:
You need a element (Elem) to get access to a BuiltInParameter, so you need to have a non empty schedule.
Parameter par = Elem.get_Parameter((BuiltInParameter) Field.ParameterId.IntegerValue);
You can find the answer to 4 in par.Definition</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>
<p>Very nice answers, thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Regarding 2, I guess I have to use the <code>FamilyManager</code> to open the families to find out if the shared parameter is a "Type" or "Instance" one.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p><a href="">Select element by id</a> is part of the standard end user interface:</p>
<p>https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/EN...</p>
<p>As said, it comes in handy for using RevitLookup to snoop element data and properties, since it can be used on invisible elements that cannot be selected in any other way as well.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> </p>
<p>I have found the post you mentioned and tried, it works well that I can find the the shared parameter visually on the Revit property panel even it is a "hidden" element, that's quite cool. :)</p>
