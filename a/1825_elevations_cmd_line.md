#### <a name="3"></a> Revit Command Line Switches Updated

We mentioned some command line switch related topics here in the past:

- [Revit Command-Line Switches](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/01/distances-switches-kiss-ing-and-a-dino.html#3)
- [Passing an Add-In Custom Command Line Parameters](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/01/face-methods-and-custom-command-line-arguments.html#2)

Vladimir Michl of [cadstudio.cz](https://www.cadstudio.cz) provides an update to these in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [Revit command-line switches list](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-command-line-switches-list/m-p/9345809):

**Question:** I am trying to find a list with all command-line switches that can be used with Revit.
Something equivalent to [this list that was shared for AutoCAD]().
I found some of them in a [previous post here](), but I am pretty sure those are just a few and not the complete list.

**Answer:** Here is a more recent [overview of runstring parameters for Revit.exe](https://www.cadforum.cz/cadforum_en/overview-of-revit-runstring-parameters-for-revit-exe-tip12524) of
the switches and parameters for the current versions for both full Revit and for Revit LT:

> Autodesk Revit (and Revit LT) is launched using the executable Revit.exe.

> In its parameters &ndash; from the desktop icon or on the command line &ndash; you can use a number of optional runstring parameters (switch, option):

- fully qualified name of a RVT/RTE/RFA file &ndash; open a given project or template or family
- fully qualified name of a journal file &ndash; execute (repeat) commands stored in the journal log file (.txt)
- /language CODE &ndash; run Revit in the given language (if the respective language pack is installed) &ndash; e.g. "/language FRA"
- /nosplash &ndash; run Revit without the initial graphical splash/jingle
- /viewer &ndash; run Revit in the no-license view-only mode (R/O)
- /runmaximized &ndash; run in a maximized application window
- /runhidden &ndash; run in an invisible (hidden) application window
- /noninteractive &ndash; run in a non-interactive mode (cannot control Revit from its UI)
- /debugmode &ndash; run in a debug mode
- /3GB (only for older, 32-bit versions) &ndash; enable access to RAM over the 2GB limit

#### <a name="4"></a> World-Wide Connectivity

In the context of arranging the
world-wide [Forge Accelerators](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/forge-accelerator),
Jaime Rosales Duque points out a handy solution for world-wide Internet connectivity:

> When I went to Colombia, I rented a device called SkyRoam.
It is a world traveller hotspot that allows you to connect up to 10 devices for unlimited data per day (9$) or per month ($80) anywhere in the world.
At the London Accelerator,  I went out and bought one outright.
So far, this little device has saved the day.
Here is the [web site where you can get the Skyroam Solis X](https://www.skyroam.com).
It is easy to operate using the mobile app on IOS or Android.
I think but it can be operated through a website too.

Many thanks to Jaime for the useful hint.
