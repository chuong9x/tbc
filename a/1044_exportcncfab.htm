<h3>ExportCncFab on GitHub and RevitLookup Update</h3>

<p>I am in a hurry, still not finding time to prepare my AU classes, and lots going on.</p>

<p>I published an add-in named ExportWallboard to automatically isolate and

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/export-wall-parts-individually-to-dxf.html">
export wall parts individually to DXF</a> for

CNC fabrication back in March, still for Revit 2013, at the time.</p>

<p>That utility is in use, was renamed to ExportCncFab and has enjoyed some further enhancement since, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for export to SAT as well as DXF</li>
<li>A beautiful little external application to define a nicer user interface</li>
<li>Support for per-part export history tracking using shared parameters</li>
</ul>

</center>

<p>The history tracking shared parameters are populated with the following values:

<ul>
<li>CncFabIsExported &ndash; a Boolean value showing whether an individual part has ever been exported</li>
<li>CncFabExportedFirst &ndash; timestamp of first export</li>
<li>CncFabExportedLast &ndash; timestamp of most recent export</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't have time to discuss all these enhancements in detail right now, but I wanted to point out their existence and publish the whole thing in its current state on GitHub.</p>

<p>So here, without more ado, is the glorious

the first public Revit 2014 release

Enjoy!</p>

<h4>RevitLookup Update</h4>

<p>I also published

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">
RevitLookup on GitHub</a> and

mentioned that some

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/10/revitlookup-on-github-and-invitation-to-collaborate.html#2">
enhancements were already made</a>.</p>

<p>Well, more have been added since by a new contributor

<a href="https://github.com/Prasadgalle">Prasadgalle</a>,

so we arrived at

<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2014.0.0.5">
release 2014.0.0.5</a>.

Thank you very much for that, Prasad!</p>
