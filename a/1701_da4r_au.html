<h4><a name="2"></a> Design Automation for Revit Public Beta Coming</h4>
<p>Mikako Harada officially announced that
the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/design-automation-revit-public-beta-coming-january-28">Design Automation for Revit public beta is coming</a> in
the beginning of next year:</p>
<p>Great news: We are happy to announce that Design Automation API for Revit (aka Revit IO) will be going to public beta on January 28, 2019. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>What is Design Automation API for Revit?</b>
<br/>It’s Revit’s engine running in the cloud as a Forge service. Build cloud-native apps and services that create, extract, and modify Revit data.
Check out the <a href="#3">Forge DevCon class FDC226894</a> highlighted below for more info.</li>
<li><b>I’m interested. What do I do?</b>
<br/>Let us know what you’d like to build: check out
the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/revitonforge">revitonforge web site</a> and
email us at <a href="mailto:revitonforge@autodesk.com">revitonforge@autodesk.com</a>.
<br/>You can start converting your Revit add-ins by following the instructions in
the <a href="zip/fdc226894_da4r_sasha_crotty_handout.pdf">FDC226894 class handout</a>.</li>
<li><b>Can I work with Autodesk to turn my idea into code?</b>
<br/>Yes! A great way to do this is to apply to the Forge Accelerator in Boston, MA on February 4-8, 2019
This is a special program to help developers leverage Autodesk Forge APIs to build next generation solutions.
The February workshop will focus on Design Automation for Revit.
Work up close and personal with the Autodesk team to turn your idea into a working prototype.

<h4><a name="3"></a> FDC226894 &ndash; Revit Data on Forge &ndash; How Can the Design Automation for Revit API Help Me?</h4>
<p>The main session presenting Forge Design Automation for Revit at the Forge DevCon at AU in Las Vegas
was <a href="https://autodeskuniversity.smarteventscloud.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=226894"><b>FDC226894</b> &ndash; Revit Data on Forge &ndash; How Can the Design Automation for Revit API Help Me?</a>:</p>
<p>The Forge Design Automation API for Revit allows you to build web applications that can create, read, and modify Revit models in the cloud. No longer is access to Revit data trapped on the desktop. Learn how Forge can help you manage and create Revit data in cloud-native applications. We'll review the different kinds of apps you will be able to build using the Design Automation API to solve your company's challenges as well as demonstrate some sample applications using the service.</p>
<p>For your convenience, here is
a <a href="zip/fdc226894_da4r_sasha_crotty_handout.pdf">direct link to the session handout</a>.</p>
<p>This session was prepared and presented by:</p>
