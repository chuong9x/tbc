question</a> on RvtMgdDbg:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Just wondering, is the 2010 version allowed to be distributed to non ADN members?

<a href="http://download.autodesk.com/media/adn/RvtMgdDbg2009_0429_2008.zip">

Just thought I'd check.</p>

<p><strong>Late addendum:</strong> It is now much, much later, March 2011, and for yet more completeness' sake, here is the complete source code, Visual Studio solution, and a compiled assembly DLL of RvtMgdDbg for Revit 2010, prompted by the
