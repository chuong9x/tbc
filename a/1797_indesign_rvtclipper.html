  This might be of interest to the building coder blog.
  I worked up your Revit implementation of the Clipper library:
  https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/boolean-operations-for-2d-polygons.html
  Added a UI where you can real-time see the result of the different options.
  For simplicity it takes sketch-based objects as input rather than just lines.
  So Filled Regions, Floors, Railings, Roofs and what not.
  Anything that has a Sketch element should work.
  So I just took what you had there and added a few things.
  Source code and short video attached:

Hi Jeremy! I develop for the Revit API (I love your blog) and I wondered if you might find the following talk we gave at AU of interest?
It's about automated publishing from Revit using a bridge we built to InDesign. It's pitched at around the level of tech understanding that your blog covers (C#, OOP and some .NET) so I think it might be a good match for your readers.

I'd love to know what you think!

One-Click PDF Model Reports: Connect Revit to the InDesign API

Jeremy Tammik  8:09 AM
thank you for your appreciation! i'll take a look. if you are interested in describing in writing some of the more interesting Revit API programming challenges your faced and how you solved or worked around them, that might make a nice wrapper for it.

Jeremy Tammik  8:15 AM
later... i read the hand-out. it is rather light on the technical details and solutions. i like the topic and the gist of the thing, though. if you would care to write in more detail about how to hooked up revit with insight and share some code snippets from the hardest steps it would certainly be of general interest. thank you.

Thanks for reading! We have a Github with some useful starter code on it (since model reviews tend to be quite company-specific we didn't want to dictate how to do it so much as just give useful code examples and principles for others to adapt as suits them). 

There's some starter code on our Github and I'm happy to bring across the several other code examples we showed in our presentation if that would be helpful! 
https://github.com/AhmmTools/AU2019/blob/master/InDesignSampleAU2019.cs

The main challenges weren't really Revit API-specific. They were more to do with working around the InDesign API. However, since the talk is aimed at beginners I've gone into as much detail as possible so others could attempt to recreate what we demoed. It might make for a nice case study in learning how to connect Revit to other software (in this case using COM).

If you think there's anything we're missing or should clarify I'll be happy to try and get some stuff together.
Many thanks to Ollie for documenting and sharing this!

<h3>Real-Time Automated PDF Report and 2D Sketch Booleans</h3>
<p>Today, we highlight two contributions by Håvard Leding and Oliver Green:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">2D Boolean interactive real-time sketch viewer</a></li>

<h4><a name="2"></a> 2D Boolean Interactive Real-Time Sketch Viewer</h4>
<p>Håvard Leding of <a href="https://www.symetri.com">Symetri</a> shares a new cool 2D Boolean geometry analysis tool, RvtClipper, saying:</p>
<p>This might be of interest to The Building Coder blog.</p>
<p>I worked up your Revit implementation of the Clipper library presented in the article 
on <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/09/boolean-operations-for-2d-polygons.html">Boolean operations for 2D polygons</a>.</p>
<p>I added a UI where you can see the result of the different options in real-time.</p>
<p>For simplicity, it takes sketch-based objects as input rather than just lines.</p>
<p>So, Filled Regions, Floors, Railings, Roofs and what not.</p>
<p>Anything that has a <code>Sketch</code> element should work.</p>
<p>I just took what you had there and added a few things.</p>
<p>Source code and short video attached:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="zip/hl_RvtClipper.zip">RvtClipper.zip</a></li>
<li><a href="zip/hl_RvtClipper_UI.mp4">RvtClipper_UI.mp4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I see in the video that RvtClipper can even generate new Revit geometry and database elements based on the 2D Boolean results!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Håvard for this impressive utility, showing how easily you can grab an external library to add really powerful functionality to your Revit add-in!</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a> Single-Click Automated PDF Report via InDesign</h4>
<p>Oliver Green shares the presentation and some utility code from his industry talk <em>AULON484 &ndash; One-Click PDF Model Reports: Connect Revit to the InDesign API</em> at Autodesk University 2019 in London, saying:</p>
