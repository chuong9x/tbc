<h4><a name="2"></a> Revit.TestRunner &ndash; Run Unit Tests in Revit</h4>
<p>We mentioned several
different <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.16">Revit add-in unit testing frameworks</a> in
the past.</p>
<p>Tobias Fl√∂scher of <a href="https://www.geberit.com">Geberit</a> now
shares a new implementation based on <a href="https://nunit.org">NUnit 3</a> that looks very promising indeed,
in the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-testrunner-run-unittests-in-revit/m-p/9070621"><code>Revit.TestRunner</code> &ndash; run unit tests in Revit</a>,
saying:</p>
<p>Hello Developers,</p>
<p>In 2018, I started to program in the Revit API environment.
It was completely new to me, so I had to get familiar with the API and its peculiarities.
I found The Building Coder blog, which helped me a lot.</p>
<p>We insourced an add-in that was originally developed by an external company.
The whole code lives in an assembly which references the Revit API.
Then I realized, testing is hard.
I refactored the code so that it was as much as possible independent from the Revit API.
This code was testable as I knew it, using tests run
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a>.
But a lot of code remained in the project referencing the Revit API.</p>
<p>I asked Google what to do, but apparently there is not THE way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>There is some stuff around that seems cool, e.g.,  <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/08/revit-unit-test-framework-improvements.html">RevitTestFramework</a>,
but I was not happy with that.
Furthermore, all I found uses NUnit 2.6, whereas all my Revit independent code is tested by the NUnit 3.x.
The build server doesn't like the mix.</p>
<p>As a result, I started to write my own TestRunner using NUnit 3.
It is far from perfect; nevertheless, I would like to share it with the community.</p>
<p>Please have a look at it in 
the <a href="https://github.com/geberit/Revit.TestRunner">Revit.TestRunner GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>tf_testrunner_start.png</p>
<p>Features so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using NUnit 3</li>
<li>No reference to Revit.TestRunner needed in test assembly</li>
<li>Support of NUnit attributes SetUp and TearDown</li>
<li>Injection of API objects in test method</li>
<li>Works as an add-in with GUI</li>
<li>Installation script for libraries</li>
<li>Post build event in VS project to place add-in manifest</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback welcome!</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Getting Started with TestRunner</h4>
<p>Get the code from GitHub and compile it.
The <em>Revit.TestRunner.addin</em> file will be automatically placed in the <em>ProgramData</em> add-in folder of the selected Revit version,</p>
<p>It is also possible to download the precompiled binaries.
Start the <em>InstallAddin v20xx.cmd</em> of your favourite Revit version and run Revit. </p>
<p>The add-in hooks into the Revit 'Add-Ins' ribbon. </p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/tf_testrunner_start.png" alt="TestRunner ribbon tab" width="347">
</center></p>
<p>By pressing the button, a dialogue will appear.
By choosing your testing assembly, the view will show all your tests:</p>
<p><center>

</center></p>
<p>Select the node you want to test and press the 'Run'. All tests below the selected node will be executed.</p>

<p>Very many thanks to Tobias for implementing, documenting and sharing this very important new tool!</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> Unconfusing Support Assemblies</h4>
<p>A quick note on 
a <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/confusing-assembly-location-when-use-one-assembly-for-two-revit/m-p/9070282">confusing assembly location when using one assembly for two Revit add-in projects</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I created a support library project implement custom classes and functions and then used this library reference in two Revit add-in projects.</p>
<p>I want to install each project separately, so each project should contain their own library assembly in their setup folder.
In this way, I can easily manage every single project without caring about others.</p>
<p>I use the method <code>Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly</code> to check where the library.dll is referring to.
When I first run the project 1, I get the correct assembly path &ndash; the project 1 folder.
Then, I run project 2 and get the unexpected result: the path is in the project 1 folder again.
This should return project 2 folder as my expectation.
A similar problem occurs if I run the project 2 first.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If you load an assembly <code>A</code> into the .NET framework from directory <code>Da</code> and then load another version of assembly <code>A</code> from a different location <code>Db</code>, the .NET framework will determine that <code>A</code> has already been loaded and reuse the existing instance from <code>Da</code>, ignoring your request to load a second instance from <code>Db</code>. There are ways to work around this, presumably, but I will not even try to dive into that. I suggest that you design your two add-ins so that they do not rely on the location of the assembly <code>A</code> that you load in any way. You can easily move your assembly location determination code out of <code>A</code> into the main two add-ins instead.</p>
