<h3>TestRunner &ndash; Run Unit Tests in Revit</h3>
<p>We have mentioned a couple
of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.16">Revit add-in unit testing frameworks</a> in
the past.</p>
<p>Tobias Flöscher of <a href="https://www.geberit.com">Geberit</a> now shares one that looks very promising indeed in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-testrunner-run-unittests-in-revit/m-p/9070621"><code>Revit.TestRunner</code> &ndash; run unit tests in Revit</a>, saying:</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a> Revit.TestRunner &ndash; Run Unit Tests in Revit</h4>
<p>Hello Developers,</p>
<p>In 2018, I started to program in the Revit API environment.
It was completely new to me, so I had to get familiar with the API and its peculiarities.
I found The Building Coder blog, which helped me a lot.</p>
<p>We insourced an add-in that was originally developed by an external company.
The whole code lives in an assembly which references the Revit API.
Then I realized, testing is hard.
I refactured the code so that it was as much as possible independent from the Revit API.
This code was testable as I knew it, using tests run
on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Contiguous Integration</a>.
But a lot of code remained in the project referencing the Revit API.</p>
<p>I asked Google what to do, but apparently there is not THE way to solve this problem.</p>
<p>There is some stuff around that seems cool, e.g.,  <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/08/revit-unit-test-framework-improvements.html">RevitTestFramework</a>),
but I was not happy with it.
Furthermore, all I found uses NUnit 2.6, whereas all my Revit independent code is tested by the NUnit 3.x.
The build server doesn’t like the mix.</p>
<p>As a result, I started to write my own TestRunner using NUnit 3.
It is far from perfect; nevertheless, I would like to share it with the community.</p>
<p>Please have a look at it in 
the <a href="https://github.com/geberit/Revit.TestRunner">Revit.TestRunner GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>Features so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using NUnit 3</li>
<li>No reference to Revit.TestRunner needed in test assembly</li>
<li>Support of NUnit attributes SetUp and TearDown</li>
<li>Injection of API objects in test method</li>
<li>Works as an addin with GUI</li>
<li>Installation script for libraries</li>
<li>Post build event in VS project to place addin file</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback welcome!</p>
<p>Very many thanks to Tobias for implementing, documenting and sharing this very important new tool!</p>
