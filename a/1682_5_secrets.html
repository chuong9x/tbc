<h3>Five Secrets of Revit API Coding</h3>
<p>Joshua Lumley pointed out the recording he made for his BILT submission on five secrets of Revit API C# coding.</p>
<p>Before getting to that, here are a couple of pictures from this last weekend's mountain tour:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a> Ruessigrat, Brotmesser and Matthorn</h4>
<p>I crossed the Ruessigrat, Brotmesser and Matthorn ridge in splendid weather on a very nice scrambling hike with Alex:</p>
<p>It can be done without a rope, although we did in fact use a rope and the route's one and only bolt for security at the narrowest point.</p>
<p>Crossing the Brotmesser (bread knife) part of the Ruessigrat ridge:</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a> Five Secrets of Revit API Coding</h4>
<p>Last year, Joshua Lumley published a half-hour recording
on <a href="https://youtu.be/KHMwd4U_Lrs">five secrets of Revit API C# coding addressing ribbon, button, macro, external events and modeless dockable add-in</a> in
Support of his abstract submission to the BILT ANZ 2018 conference in Brisbane:</p>

<p>He very kindly 'spilled the beans', disclosing what secrets are discussed at what time points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never initiate your coding project from an external IDE. Rather use Revit Macro Manager, then switch to a third-party IDE such as Visual Studio. This process sets everything up for you with relative paths which is critical if end user has not installed Revit on C drive. 3m:55s</li>
<li>Use <code>Invoke</code> to run external commands instead of embedding references. This will prevent many hours watching the Revit splash screen when restarting. 6m:55s</li>
<li>Always use modeless forms rather than modal ones, i.e., <code>Show</code> instead of <code>ShowDialog</code>. This allows for freedom of movement for the end user and opens the potential for creating a dockable panel in the future. 12m:40s</li>
<li>Like Russian dolls, encase your database interactions inside transactions, which are in turn encased inside a try-catch, which in turn is encased inside an external event.  This nesting is the hardest thing to get your head around but absolutely necessary. 17m.15s</li>
<li>Iterate rapidly, and seek peer review as early in the project as possible. I've found canvassing somebody elseâ€™s opinion early, can radically change the initial design intent and 'mental image' I had of my add-in. </li>
</ol>
<p>Very many thanks to Joshua for sharing his extensive Revit API experience, both here and in many other helpful comments and discussion threads!</p>
