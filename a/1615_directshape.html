- loft form creation speed ---  >> directshape
  [Q] I have a developer from Revit Vanguard having a function which create a new mass family and load it in the project, but he cannot provide this function due to take much time to create a loft form.
  He creates a form by using Document.FamilyCreate.NewLoftForm with ReferenceArray of CurveByPoints or ModelCurve.
  I think that it seems to be general way to create Family.
  I tested the attached minimal sample code, I got a similar result as he mentioned.
  It takes about 4 minutes to create a family in the test code.
  Eventually, he wants to visualize calculation result of sky view factor by 3D model.
  And his addin already works well in ArchCad as the same function.
  Is there any work-around to create a loft form more faster?
  [A] depending on the kind of geometry he wants to create, he might be able to use a DirectShape element instead.
  that should be about 100 times faster.

[Q] You state in Point 3 "... create a DirectShape element using the 'solid' geometry created above." Where can I find code which shows how to do that?
[A] You just have to package the solid in a GeometryObject Array, then DirectShape.CreateElement works: https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2016/ENU/Revit-API/files/GUID-DF7B9D4A-5A8A-4E39-8721-B7782CBD7730-htm.html
