<h3>Mechanical Duct Types</h3>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
When selecting duct type properties, under the mechanical heading, various fitting property values are specified.
How can I find out what property a given fitting belongs to, i.e. is it an elbow, a transition or cross etc.?
Obviously, the type of fitting is described in the family name, but is there a more definite way of knowing what kind of fitting it is through the API?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
In Revit 2009, you can use the built-in parameter FAMILY_CONTENT_PART_TYPE.
You can access it through the following series of properties:</p>

<p>FamilyInstance > Symbol > Family > Parameter > BuiltInParameter.FAMILY_CONTENT_PART_TYPE.</p>

<p>This parameter stores an integer value. The values for the different types are:</p>

<pre>
kUndefinedPartType = -1,
kNormal            = 0,
kDuctMounted       = 1,
kJunctionBox       = 2,
kAttachesTo        = 3,
kBreaksInto        = 4,
kElbow             = 5,
kTee               = 6,
kTransition        = 7,
kCross             = 8,
kCap               = 9,
kTapPerpendicular  = 10,
kTapAdjustable     = 11,
kOffset            = 12,
kUnion             = 13,
kPanelBoard        = 14,
kTransformer       = 15,
kSwitchBoard       = 16,
kOtherPanel        = 17,
kEquipmentSwitch   = 18,
kSwitch            = 19,
kValveBreaksInto   = 20,
kSpudPerpendicular = 21,
kSpudAdjustable    = 22,
kDamper            = 23,
kWye               = 24,
kLateralTee        = 25,
kLateralCross      = 26,
kPants             = 27,
kMultiPort         = 28,
kValveNormal       = 29,
