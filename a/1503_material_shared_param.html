<h3>Shared Parameter on Material and ADN Xtra Labs Update</h3>
<p>Can we attach a shared parameter to <code>Material</code> elements?</p>
<p>Yes we can!</p>
<p>In the course of proving that, I finally updated the ADN Xtra labs to remove all deprecated API usage.</p>
<p>And, talking about materials, the Autodesk University 2016 class materials have now been posted, including the recording of my session on connecting desktop and cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, I end with an absolutely non-technical topic, on healing:</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>ADN Xtra Labs Updated</h4>
<p>The last time I worked on the <em>ADN Xtra Labs</em> hosted in 
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra">AdnRevitApiLabsXtra GitHub repository</a> was for
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/08/trusted-signature-and-updated-revit-2017-api-resources.html#5">Revit 2017 migration</a>,
and the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/06/adn-labs-xtra-multi-version-add-ins-and-cnc-direct.html#2">migration to Revit 2016</a> before that.</p>
<p>They are a superset of the
official <a href="">ADN Revit API labs training material</a>
(<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/autodesk-university-q1-adn-labs-and-wizard-update.html#4">2016</a>)
available from
the <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">Revit Developer Centre</a> and
the <a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial">Revit API Training GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>They are used for our standard two- or three-day hands-on Revit API introduction training courses.
They are also suitable for self-learning and include full step-by-step instructions, separate for both C# and VB add-ins.</p>
<p>I maintain an extended version of these including the precursor versions, repackaged in the ADN Revit API Training Labs Xtra modules.</p>
<p>The Xtra version Visual Studio solution implements the following projects:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/AdnXtra_solution.png" alt="ADN Revit API Training Labs Xtra Visual Studio solution" width="210"/>
</center></p>
<p>The first six are the official, standard, ADN training labs to introduce the Revit API basics, UI programming and Family API.</p>
<p>Obviously, the Xtra labs have advantages and disadvantages over the standard labs, so you should check out both and decide which you prefer for yourself.</p>
<p>They also include a couple of additional utilities that I frequently find useful, especially a simplified version of the
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/05/geometry-creation-and-line-intersection-exceptions.html#5">BipChecker</a>
(<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/bipchecker-for-revit-2015-on-github.html#3">2015</a>) and the
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/debugging-and-maintaining-the-image-relationship.html#2">element lister</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I left off the migration to the Revit 2017 API before it was entirely completed; several of the external commands were still making use of the obsolete and deprecated automatic transaction mode.</p>
<p>I finally got around to fixing that now, resulting in a
new <a href="">release </a>.</p>
<p>You can examine the changes I made
by <a href="">comparing versions ...</a>.</p>
<p>Here is my external application RvtSamples listing entry points to launch all the Revit SDK, ADN Xtra lab and The Building Coder samples:</p>

<p>As always, the most up-to-date version of the ADN Revit API Training Labs Xtra is provided in the
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra">AdnRevitApiLabsXtra GitHub repository</a>,
and the current version right now is
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2016.0.0.6">release 2016.0.0.6</a>.</p></p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Linking <code>Material</code> Elements to External Database Entries</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible (maybe through API?) to assign new parameters for materials?</p>
<p>The original question in in German:</p>
<p><em>Um die Bilanzierung der Materialmassen zu automatisieren, wäre es hilfreich den Materialien in Revit eine Datenbank-ID zuzuschreiben, welche dauerhaft im Modell mitwandert. Über shared Parameter konnte ich bisher nur Elemente (Wand), aber nicht den untergeordneten Materialien zuschreiben. Die Funktionenen des Materialkatalogs wirken eingeschränkt. Gibt es hierfür Möglichkeiten Materialparameter neu zu erstellen?</em></p>
<p>Practically he would like to add specific IDs (parameters) to materials that he could write out to a database. He mentions the analogy with shared parameters &ndash; it seems he would like to create custom shared parameters and add them to materials.</p>
<p>Do you know any solution for this idea?</p>
<p><strong>Answer 1:</strong></p>
<p>so, the user has an external database and wishes to link revit materials to database entries.</p>
<p>that is good, and easy.</p>
<p>now i would suggest that we all switch on our brains for a moment, escpecially this developer.</p>
<p>the revit materials reside in the revit database and are therefore revit elements.</p>
<p>they are therefore equipped with an element id and a unique id.</p>
<p>the external database exists and has entries for the materials, and needs some kind of link.</p>
<p>the developer is now considering to add something new to the revit database, e.g. a shared parameter on each material.</p>
<p>that is completely unnecessary, as far as i can tell.</p>
<p>since he is already managing an external database, and since each material already is equipped with a unique id, i would suggest that he use that existing unique id to identify the material, and store that in the database.</p>
<p>if he needs to link multiple materials to the same database entry and is using a relational database, he might want to implement a 1:n link using an auxiliary table.</p>
<p>unless there is more to the problem than has been mentioned so far, i would maintain that this is the most efficient solution.</p>
<p>it also has the advantage of solving the problem without introducing any new data elements or shared parameters anywhere.</p>
<p>what do you think?</p>
<p>what does the developer think?</p>
<p>on the other hand, if he insists on pursuing the path he suggests, the fact is that as far as i know any revit element can be equipped with a shared parameter, as long as it has a valid category.</p>
<p>is there a category for materials?</p>
<p>if so, materials can have a shared parameter attached to them.</p>
<p>here is an explanation of this:</p>
<p>http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/11/adding-a-shared-parameter-to-a-dwg-file.html</p>
<p>here is a list of things i already tested:</p>
<p>https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/blob/master/XtraCs/Labs4.cs#L511-L535</p>
<p>i am just in the process of testing for myself whether a shared param can be added to a material as well.</p>
<p>i'll let you know when i know.</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong></p>
<p>i verified and tested successfully that shared parameters can be added to material elements.</p>
<p>you can see so by checking out and running version</p>
<p>https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.6</p>
<p>i switched backl to the standard test using doors again after that, in version</p>
<p>https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.7</p>
<p>the link to the list of things i already tested has changed, since the line numbers moved:</p>
<p>https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/blob/master/XtraCs/Labs4.cs#L518-L539</p>
<p>You should also always be aware of the possibility to
use <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.23">extensible storage</a> instead
of shared parameters to store custom data, cf. also the SDK samples ExtensibleStorageManager and ExtensibleStorageUtility.</p>
<p>Shared parameters make sense if the user and/or Revit should be aware of the properties, e.g. to view or edit them in the properties panel or to make us of them for scheduling purposes.</p>
<p>If the data is purely intended for internal add-in use, extensible storage is normally the better way to go.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Binding a Shared Parameter to Elements</h4>
<p>One way to add customm properties to Revit elements is by using a shared parameter.
If you can do that in the user interface, then you can do so programmatically as well.</p>
<p>The FireRating SDK sample shows how this can be achieved, and so does my modernised version of it,
<a href="">FireRatingCloud</a>, in
the <a href="">module ...</a>.</p>
<p>However, this is one of the few things that can be done programmatically for some element types even when it is not allowed in the UI.
If the Revit development team decided that the end user should not be able to add a shared parameter to a certain element type, it will not show up in the UI.
As long as it has a valid category, you can mostly attach a shared parameter to it programmatically anyway.</p>
<p>The option <code>xxx</code> is related to this...</p>
