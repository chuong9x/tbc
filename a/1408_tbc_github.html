- blog:
  - use github as a blog base? via wiki?
  - open source blog platform?
  - keep in parallel with typepad tbc?
  - implement local url base for all links
  - clear out comments, email addresses and confidential stuff
  - put all blog source code on github

- blog on github
  Kean Walmsley has been playing around with [moving Threough the Interface from Typepad to Wordpress]().
  I looked at various alternative options as well.

<h3>tbc &ndash; The Building Coder Source and Index on GitHub</h3>
<p>Developers frequently lament bad search functionality on Typepad-hosted blogs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is always handy to have an an offline local copy of any kind of important documentation you need to cansult.</p>
<p>With a local copy the The Building Coder source text, you can use your standard system tools to search and index locally in any form you like.</p>
<p>Finally, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple line-by-line index of all The Building Coder blog posts ever published?</p>
<p>I took these requirements into account right from the start when setting out
on <a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com">The 3D Web Coder</a>,
as I explained in the discussion
on <a href="http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/hosting-a-node-server-on-heroku-pages-and-3d-web.html#2">hosting its source HTML and index on GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
<p>I have obviously been pondering doing the same for The Building Coder ever since &ndash; well, actually, to tell the truth, I started thinking about that much earlier still.</p>
<p>Now I finally took the leap.</p>
<p>The entire source text for all posts ever published by The Building Coder is available online from the
new <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc">tbc GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>It creates a GitHub-pages-hosted entry point
with <a href="https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a">The Building Coder Index</a>
at <a href="https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a">jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a</a>.</p>
<p>You can also jump directly to <a href="https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a#6">the table of contents at #6</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a blog reading platform, it just provides a very handy public search and replication tool.</p>
<p>In case you wonder about the trailing <code>a</code> in this URL:
the reason for the additional 'a' subfolder is that GitHub sets a limit of 1000 to the number of files it lists in a single folder in the UI.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>GitHub Size Limitations</h4>
<p>I hit a couple of limits built into GitHub and had to implement workarounds to handle some of them:</p>
<p>I already mentioned the limitation displaying no more than 1000 files per directory entry.</p>
<p>My blog posts currently number over 1400, so I exceed that, but can live with the situation as it is.</p>
<p>If you have more than 1000 files in one directory, some of the them are not displayed and you see a warning message saying "Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. XXX entries were omitted from the list":</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/github_directory_truncated_1000.png" alt="GitHub directory truncated to 1000 files" width="505">
</center></p>
<p>Without the 'a' subfolder, the README.md in the top level folder was hidden by all the blog posts and therrefore not displayed.</p>
<p>The killer was that its contents were also not shown.</p>
<p>I added <code>a</code> to hold the blog posts and left <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/README.md">README.md</a> in the top-level directory.</p>
<p>A simpler issue occured with images and attachments.</p>
<p>They live in the two subfolders <code>img</code> and <code>zip</code>, respectively, currently weighing in at 225 and 410 MB in total size.</p>
<p>Luckily, all the indivisual image and attachment file sizes are smaller than 100 MB, or GitHub would refuse to host them at all.</p>
<p>As it is, I just got warning messages on two or three files that exceeded a threshold of 30 MB, but were still accepted.</p>
<p>The largest image file
is the 77-MB <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/a/img/monitor_progress.gif">monitor_progress.gif</a>,
which is an animated GIF, i.e. a video screen recording, so not a still image at all.</p>
<p>The largest attachment is <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/a/zip/track_changes.mp4">track_changes.mp4</a>,
another recording, 63 MB in size.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Alternative Blogging Platforms</h4>
<p>As you may be aware, my
colleague <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/about-the-author.html">Kean Walmsley</a> has
been thinking
of <a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/01/yet-another-blog-design-on-its-way.html">moving his blog Through the nterface from Typepad to Wordpress</a> for
a while now.</p>
<p>He mentions that the killer feature of WordPress is search, considering that Typepad fails miserably on this count.</p>
<p>I think that I can fix that problem satisfactorily for all by making my entire blog source text available in this manner, and offer several additional benefits as well.</p>
<p>For a alternative blogging platform you might also be interested in reading
about <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole">creating a beautiful and minimal blog using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole</a>,
entirely avoiding blog servers like Typepad and WordPress, where you give up control over your data.</p>
<p>So all things considered, my current tendency is to keep the main blog staying put on Typepad.</p>
<p>The purpose of the GitHub version is not normal everyday reading, but safe backup and version management, providing full source access to all readers and a version that people can clone for local searching and offline access.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a">global index</a> is just an additional perk.</p>
<p>I use the index file locally myself all the time, hundreds of times every day.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Fork and Clone to Create your own Local Installation</h4>
<p>To install your own local copy of The Building Coder, fork and clone the
repository <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc">github.com/jeremytammik/tbc</a> and
open <code>index.html</code> like this, with just two commands:</p>
<pre>
/j/tmp/ $ git clone https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc
Cloning into 'tbc'...

/j/tmp/ $ open tbc/a/index.html
</pre>

<p>Et voila, Bob's your uncle!</p>
<p>You have your own local copy ot The Building Coder on your system, including the full index and all source text.</p>
<p>Please be patient while cloning, because the entire package including images and attachments adds up to over 1 GB of data.</p>
<p>The layout is not in a nice blog format, of course. That is not its purpose.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>El Perro Semihundido by Goya</h4>
<p>Let's end the week enjoying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Goya">Goya</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dog_(Goya)">The Dog</a> &ndash; <em>El Perro Semihundido</em> &ndash; painted on the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823, for his exclusive private enjoyment:</p>
