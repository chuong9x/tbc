  I created a business card for myself based on NFC after Jim Quanci pointed out the possibility.
  I grabbed the ... card from a Google cardboard set.

<p>We only just noticed that another interesting inaugural meetup is taking place in the same location at the same time, the

<a href="http://www.meetup.com/MM-MeanMilan/events/218926426">First MEAN Event: Break the Ice</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mean.io">MEAN</a> stands for MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js, so you can see how well it fits.</p>

<p>Main topic for today: new functionality of

<h4>My New Near Field Communication Business Card</h4>

<p>We have been handing out Google cardboard boxes at our meetup events.</p>

<p>Each box includes an

<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">
NFC</a> card.

Simply hold it against the back of your NFC-enabled phone and it will take you straight to the <a href="http://www.dodocase.com">Dodocase</a> web site.</p>

<p>You can easily reprogram it to take you to any other URL you like, in just 60 seconds, e.g. using the free

<a href="http://www.tagstand.com">Tagstand NFC Writer</a>.

There are lots of other free NFC write apps in the mobile stores as well.</p>

<p>I grabbed a card and set it up to link to
