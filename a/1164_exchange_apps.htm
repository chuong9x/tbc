<h3>Exchange Apps Webinar Recording and Resources</h3>

<p>As you certainly know by now, the Autodesk Exchange Stores provide an efficient means to showcase and distribute your applications addressing a large world-wide audience.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is very easy.
As krispy just said in this Revit API forum thread on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Revit-API/Create-installer-for-Revit-application/m-p/5062692">creating an installer for a Revit application</a>, "You can just zip up the files they require (dll, addin, etc.) and upload that... the exchange app team will create the installer for you. They are pretty good with telling you what you need to add if you have not provided enough information."</p>

<p>Jim Quanci and Stephen Preston presented a

webinar on the Autodesk Exchange Apps store</a> on May 22<sup>nd</sup>.</p>

<p>The webinar was recorded and is now available for viewing on

<h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmMjH8DycP4">Autodesk Exchange Apps &ndash; Webinar for Publishers</a></h4>

<p>Jim Quanci and Stephen Preston present the status of the Autodesk Exchange Apps store and explain recent enhancements for publishers. Note that this is a webcast recording, so audio quality is not the best.</p>

<p>The length of the recording &ndash; one and a half hours &mdash; is due to the Q&A at the end.
Several interesting questions were asked and you might find the information useful.
The actual webinar content runs to 1 hour 14 minutes.</p>
