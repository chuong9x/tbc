### Forge Formats, Webinars and Fusion 360 Client API

I updated
the [WebGL and Forge introduction for BIM programming](http://jeremytammik.github.io/forge_bim_programming) and
its [GitHub source](https://github.com/jeremytammik/forge_bim_programming) for
the presentations in the coming days at 
the [RTC Revit Technology Conference Europe](http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2016eur) and 
the [ISEPBIM](https://www.facebook.com/ISEPBIM) Forge and BIM workshops at [ISEP](http://www.isep.ipp.pt), 
the [Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto](http://www.isep.ipp.pt),
implemented two little `curl` wrapper scripts to help me list the supported file formats, explored why they changed and updated the hackathon webinar overview.

Before getting to that, though, I'll also highlight a helpful little note by Christian on how to access the 'Symbolic Representation' setting:

- ['Symbolic Representation' setting parameter](#1)
- [Forge intro for BIM programming](#2)
- [`cURL` wrapper scripts to list Forge file formats](#3)
- [Updated Forge file formats](#4)
- [Forge hackathon webinar series and Fusion 360 Client API recording](#5)


#### <a name="1"></a>'Symbolic Representation' Setting Parameter

Christian shared how to access the 'Symbolic Representation' setting in a family definition in 
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160) thread
on [symbolic representation - parameter](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/symbolic-representation-parameter/m-p/6623135):
 
> just wanted to share some code as I "lost" one hour of my life to look for it. If you want to access the setting for "Symbolic Representation" inside a family document, here we go:

<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Parameter</span>&nbsp;param&nbsp;=&nbsp;famdoc.OwnerFamily.get_Parameter(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">BuiltInParameter</span>.FAMILY_SYMBOLIC_REP&nbsp;);
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">if</span>(&nbsp;param&nbsp;!=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">null</span>&nbsp;)
&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;0&nbsp;-&nbsp;From&nbsp;Family&nbsp;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;From&nbsp;Project&nbsp;Setting</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;param.Set(&nbsp;1&nbsp;);
&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre>

Thank you very much for sharing that, Christian!


#### <a name="2"></a>Forge Intro for BIM Programming

[Forge for BIM Programming](https://github.com/jeremytammik/forge_bim_programming) is
a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation
on [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl)
and [Autodesk Forge platform](https://developer.autodesk.com) introduction.

It was first used for
the [BIM Programming](http://www.bimprogramming.com) conference
and workshops in Madrid, January 2016, and now updated for 
the [RTC Revit Technology Conference Europe](http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2016eur) and 
the [ISEPBIM](https://www.facebook.com/ISEPBIM) Forge and BIM workshops at [ISEP](http://www.isep.ipp.pt), 
the [Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto](http://www.isep.ipp.pt) in Porto, October 2016.

For more information on Forge, please refer
to the overview at [forge.autodesk.com](https://forge.autodesk.com)
and all the technical details, samples and further documentation
at [developer.autodesk.com](https://developer.autodesk.com).

#### <a name="3"></a>`cURL` Wrapper Scripts to List Forge File Formats

One of the slides in the presentation above lists the file formats currently supported by the Forge platform.

This list can be obtained by a REST call to
the [Forge](https://developer.autodesk.com/)
[Model Derivative API](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/overview/)
[GET formats](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/formats-GET/) endpoint:

<pre class="prettyprint">
curl -X 'GET' -H 'Authorization: Bearer ztcaB2R0f92bsV6iV0bSDgwmSVaW' -v 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/designdata/formats'
</pre>

We need to supply a valid access token, though, instead of the placeholder listed above.

This in turn is obtained by a call to
the [authentication](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/overview/)
[POST authenticate](https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2/reference/http/authenticate-POST/) endpoint,
specifying our client id and secret.

To easily complete this two-step process from the command line, I implemented two Unix shell scripts, `forgeauth` and `forgeformats`.

The former retrieves my client id and secret from two environment variables and calls the `authenticate` endpoint like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash

curl -v 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/authentication/v1/authenticate' -X 'POST' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d "client_id=$ROOMEDIT3DV3_PROD_CONSUMER_KEY&client_secret=$ROOMEDIT3DV3_PROD_CONSUMER_SECRET&grant_type=client_credentials&scope=data:read"

echo "Now you might want to export FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=... for consumption by forgeformats"
</pre>

This returns the following JSON formatted access token data:

<pre class="prettyprint">
{"access_token":"XzVxWJoVbNWcnJeKJPRnkYjp1tgt","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":86399}
</pre>

As the script suggests, I store the transient access token in another environment variable `FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`:

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ export FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=XzVxWJoVbNWcnJeKJPRnkYjp1tgt
</pre>

From there, it is retrieved by the second script, `forgeformats`, which feeds it into the second endpoint like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash
curl -X 'GET' -H &quot;Authorization: Bearer $FORGE_ACCESS_TOKEN&quot; -v 'https://developer.api.autodesk.com/modelderivative/v2/designdata/formats'
</pre>

Right now, that returns the following list:

<pre class="prettyprint">
{"formats":{"svf":["3dm","3ds","asm","catpart","catproduct","cgr","collaboration","dae","dgn","dlv3","dwf","dwfx","dwg","dwt","dxf","exp","f3d","fbx","g","gbxml","iam","idw","ifc","ige","iges","igs","ipt","jt","model","neu","nwc","nwd","obj","pdf","prt","rcp","rvt","sab","sat","session","skp","sldasm","sldprt","smb","smt","ste","step","stl","stla","stlb","stp","stpz","wire","x_b","x_t","xas","xpr","zip","prt\\.\\d+$","neu\\.\\d+$","asm\\.\\d+$"],"thumbnail":["3dm","3ds","asm","catpart","catproduct","cgr","collaboration","dae","dgn","dlv3","dwf","dwfx","dwg","dwt","dxf","exp","f3d","fbx","g","gbxml","iam","idw","ifc","ige","iges","igs","ipt","jt","model","neu","nwc","nwd","obj","pdf","prt","rcp","rvt","sab","sat","session","skp","sldasm","sldprt","smb","smt","ste","step","stl","stla","stlb","stp","stpz","wire","x_b","x_t","xas","xpr","zip","prt\\.\\d+$","neu\\.\\d+$","asm\\.\\d+$"],"stl":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","wire"],"step":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","wire"],"iges":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","wire"],"obj":["f3d","fbx","iam","ipt","step","stp","stpz","wire"]}}
</pre>

#### <a name="4"></a>Updated Forge file formats

Here is the list of extensions currently returned by call to the `formats` endpoint shown above, cleaned up and alphabetically sorted:

- 3dm, 3ds, asm, asm, catpart, catproduct, cgr, collaboration, dae, dgn, dlv3, dwf, dwfx, dwg, dwt, dxf, exp, f3d, fbx, g, gbxml, iam, idw, ifc, ige, iges, igs, ipt, jt, model, neu, neu, nwc, nwd, obj, pdf, prt, prt, rcp, rvt, sab, sat, session, skp, sldasm, sldprt, smb, smt, ste, step, stl, stla, stlb, stp, stpz, wire, x_b, x_t, xas, xpr, zip

I compared that with the previous list that I generated in January:

- 3dm, 3ds, asm, bmp, cam360, catpart, catproduct, cgr, csv, dae, dlv3, doc, docx, dwf, dwfx, dwg, dwt, exp, f3d, fbx, g, gbxml, iam, ifc, ige, iges, igs, ipt, jpeg, jpg, jt, model, neu, nwc, nwd, obj, pdf, png, pps, ppt, pptx, prt, rcp, rtf, rvt, sab, sat, session, sim, sim360, skp, sldasm, sldprt, smb, smt, ste, step, stl, stla, stlb, stp, tif, tiff, txt, wire, x_b, x_t, xas, xls, xlsx, xpr, zip

As you can see, support for quite a number of new formats has been added.
 
A few have also been removed, such as BMP and TIFF.
 
I asked for an explanation for that, and learned the following:

Here are the ones that seem to have been added:
 
- collaboration, dgn, dxf, idw, stpz
 
We assume it was easy (and made sense) to extend to more CAD-related formats such as `dgn`, `dxf` and `idw`.

`Stpz` is probably just compressed STP, so that was presumably a no-brainer, too.
 
The following have been removed:
 
- bmp, cam360, csv, doc, docx, jpeg, jpg, png, pps, ppt, pptx, rtf, sim, sim360, tif, tiff, txt, xls, xlsx
 
Aside from `cam360`, `sim` and `sim360`, these are all Office or image formats.

Some were not actually supported by the Model Derivative service but are supported in the A360 product and its viewers.

This looks like good progress, to me.

Many thanks to Adam, Kean and Lee for their analysis, suggestions and clarifications!
