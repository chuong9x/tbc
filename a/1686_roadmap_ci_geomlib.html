&ndash; Configuring CI to use the RevittestFramework](https://github.com/upcodes/RevitTestFramework/blob/mark/Revit2019/docs/using_with_ci.md)
We recently discussed some [Revit Unit Test Framework Improvements](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/08/revit-unit-test-framework-improvements.html).
Mark Vulfson now added some very informative additional notes on [Configuring CI to use the RevittestFramework](https://github.com/upcodes/RevitTestFramework/blob/mark/Revit2019/docs/using_with_ci.md).

- geometry library in addition to revit
a little [twitter discussion](https://twitter.com/HossZamani/status/1035128771735474179) on geometry library 
with [Hoss Zamani](https://twitter.com/HossZamani)
Q: This is an excerpt of the awesome Building Coder blog by @jeremytammik in 2008. 10 years from this post Revit still doesn't provide a solid Geometry library through its API? Is it only me that finds this absurd?

A: Yes.  :-)
R: Lol. Apparently you're right ðŸ™‚ But why is that, that the developers are expected to have their own math library? Why a software that one of its main uses is to create geometry, makes it so hard to create & manipulate geometry through its API?
A: because the main purpose is NOT to create geometry, like a geometry library, freeform, unrestricted. the one and only purpose is to manage a BIM, which is almost exactly the opposite of freeform unrestricted geometry.
therefore, if you want to create geometry yourself, you really will need your own geometry library, and revit will not do very much to help. although its geometry library is gradually also adding some read-write access... previously, it was totally and purely read-only...

<h4><a name="4"></a> Revit Geometry Library Limitations</h4>
<p>People often ask why the Revit geometry library is not as full-fledged as some others, e.g., AutoCAD ObjectARX <code>AcGe</code>.</p>
<p>Here are some thought of mine on that subject from 
a <a href="https://twitter.com/HossZamani/status/1035128771735474179">twitter discussion on geometry library</a>
