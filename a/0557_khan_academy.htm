<h3>Khan Academy</h3>

<p>Kean came up with another 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2011/03/ted-education-and-matrix-mathematics.html">
brilliant item</a> that 

I cannot resist highlighting here as well, even if only to ensure that I myself don't lose track of this link to the non-profit

<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">
Khan Academy</a> myself.

It has the motto "Watch. Practice. Learn almost anything &ndash; for free" and consists of a small team on a mission to deliver a world-class education to anyone anywhere.
Topics include areas of interest for Revit API users such as

algebra</a>, 

<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Geometry">
geometry</a>, 

<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Trigonometry">
trigonometry</a> and 

<a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/#Linear%20Algebra">
linear algebra</a>, 

but it doesn't stop there, by any means...

<h4>Friday in Jeddah</h4>

<p>So far, my stay here in Jeddah has not been particularly enthralling.

Friday is the most important day of prayer, the 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia#Culture">
holiest day</a> of 

the week, so all the shops and virtually everything else as well was closed all day today.

I went for a huge walk around town anyway and did by chance happen upon the 

<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/saudi-arabia/hejaz/jeddah/sights/market/fish-market">
fish market</a> followed

by a walk through the old town in Al-Balad and As Sabil. 

<!-- which was a bit dreary with everything closed. -->

The long route back happened to lead me to a very good late lunch at the Turkish restaurant 

<a href="http://www.jeddahfood.com/?p=87">
Y1ld1zlar</a> (stars)



[<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/saudi-arabia/hejaz/jeddah/restaurants/lebanese/yildizlar">2</a>].

Sadly, I was unable to find any nice park or 

<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/saudi-arabia/hejaz/jeddah/sights/beach/beaches">
beach</a> to 

sit down on, so I returned to the hotel and a swim in the pool, dead beat. 

I passed the evening in the very pleasant company of my hosts Ammar and Yassin of 

<a href="http://www.d-perspective.com">
Digital perspective Co., Ltd.</a>

and had an even better meal in 

<a href="http://www.sufrati.com/saudi-arabian-dining/restaurant/saudi/cuisine-halawani">
Cuisine Halwani</a> on

Tahlia Street highlighting a totally delicious

<a href="http://islamic-cookingclub.blogspot.com/2009/09/fatet-makdous-with-tomatesauce.html">
fatet makdous</a> or

They confirm that there is not much to do here except eat and shop...
And prepare Revit API training material, happily...
