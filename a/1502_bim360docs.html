<h4><a name="2"></a>BIM 360 and C4R Success Story</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/bim-360/overview">BIM 360</a> had its best quarter ever.</p>
<p>It has come a long way in connecting the office to the field.
It is a smash hit with construction companies around the world and remains the fastest growing product in Autodesk history.</p>
<p>It scored a big win at <a href="http://www.jedunn.com">JE Dunn Construction</a> and several other important sites.</p>
<p>At the same time,
<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/collaboration-for-revit/overview">Collaboration for Revit (C4R)</a> is
bringing collaboration to the design and engineering office and connecting BIM teams around the world.  </p>
<p>We continue to see enterprise wide adoption of C4R with customer quotes saying things like, <em>'C4R has connected our design offices like no other tool has before.  It has transformed how we workshare, for the better'</em>.</p>
<p>Autodesk is working on bringing these two technologies together to form a common data environment that spans the entire project from concept to commissioning to building operations and beyond.</p>
<p>The common data environment can be programmatically accessed and driven through the Forge web services.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Forge Web Services</h4>
<p>Here are the main groups Forge web service endpoints as of today &ndash; please always refer
to <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">developer.autodesk.com</a> for the most up-to-date list:</p>
<ul>
<li>General Availability<ul>
<li>Authentication (OAuth)</li>
<li>Data Management API</li>
<li>Design Automation API</li>
<li>Model Derivative API</li>
<li>Viewer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Beta<ul>
<li>3D Print API (deprecated)</li>
<li>BIM 360 API</li>
<li>Reality Capture API</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="4"></a>BIM 360 Docs</h4>
<p><a href="http://info.bim360.autodesk.com/construction-document-software">BIM 360 Docs</a> provides real-time access to the most recent versions of digital plans and documents, so contractors, foremen, document managers, architects, and other key personnel can spend less time struggling with files and more time building. From concept to completion, BIM 360 software helps the entire team stay on-schedule.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>The Forge Issues Service API</h4>
<p>Mikako Harada and Galia Traub presented a session
on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOQEyI-EMAQ">extending BIM 360 Docs with the Issues Service API</a>
at <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2016">Forge DevCon 2016</a>:</p>

</center></p>
<p>This session introduces the Issues Service, one of the first BIM 360 APIs to be made available in Forge.
It allows users to create issues related to documents that are stored either in BIM 360 Docs, or more broadly within the Forge ecosystem. It walks you step-by-step through using the Issues API and showing what is possible through a series of demonstrations of practical examples.</p>
<p>The article
on the <a href="https://blog.a360.autodesk.com/a360-release-enhanced-commenting-and-markup-tools">enhanced commenting experience with in-canvas comments</a> shows 
what use the A360 development team have made of the issues API.</p>
<p>One really good aspect of the collection of Forge web services is that the Autodesk development teams and external developers have the exact same glueing and connecting tools at hand.
In other words, so do you!</p>
<p>Mikako also presented
an <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2016/10/introduction-to-bim-360.html">introduction to BIM360</a> as part of
the <a href="#7">Forge Hackathon webinar series, cf. below</a>. </p>
