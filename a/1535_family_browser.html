<h3>WPF Revit Family Browser and Vacation</h3>
<p>Just for your information, I am away on vacation now.</p>
<p>Please don't expect any Revit API related activity from me here, on
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a>,
or anywhere else during the coming week.</p>
<p>Happily, I have something else to share with you and possibly help keep you busy and entertained in the meantime:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/RomanLavrov">Roman Lavrov</a> shared
his <a href="https://github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser">Revit Family Browser</a>, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am working on family browser for Revit using Revit API and WPF.
Your blog helps me a lot, so I decide to share my work with you.
I think, some ideas will be useful for other coders.
If you have time, please take a look my program on GitHub
at <a href="https://github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser">github.com/RomanLavrov/RevitFamilyBrowser</a>. </p>

<p>I wish everybody a happy and productive time while I am gone!</p>
