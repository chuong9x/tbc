<h3>Batch Processing and Aspects of AsStringValue</h3>
<p>I avoid answering non-confidential questions in private, as I tell everyone who tries to do so.</p>
<p>However, some non-confidential queries still come in via ADN, the Autodesk Developer Network.</p>
<p>Here are two that came in today that might be of general interest and therefore seem worth sharing:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a> Batch Processing Revit Families and Documents</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Revit 2019 is leaking memory when importing families.
We need to do this 1000s of times using automation.
It is a blocking issue.</p>
<p>Please can you advise?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Revit on the desktop is an end user product designed for manual use through the manual user interface.</p>
<p>If you are using it to perform any kind of operation thousands of times, you are using it in an unexpected manner.</p>
<p>You should not be surprised if you run into problems eventually.</p>
<p>The standard method to handle such tasks is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep exact track of processing so you always know what has been processed so far and what still need to be done.</li>
<li>Monitor the process health.</li>
<li>Shut down, restart and continue where you left off if the process starts deteriorating or terminates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is more on the topic of using Revit as a server
for <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/08/batch-processing-dwfx-links-and-future-proofing.html#4">batch processing Revit documents</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/fireratingcloud-context-and-architecture.html#3">Revit is not designed to be used as a server</a>, and the EULA actually prohibits such use.</p>
<p>A better and more robust alternative nowadays that also saves you the maintenance of a local Revit installation and enables integration of your batch processing into other web-based workflows is to perform your batch processing using
the <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview">Forge Design Automation API for Revit</a>.</p>
<p>Here are more articles describing specific aspects
of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.55">DA4R, or Design Automation for Revit</a></p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> AsString and AsValueString Results Differ</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am running into a problem using <code>AsValuesString</code> and <code>AsString</code>.</p>
<p>They return different values.</p>
<p>For instance, a view has a parameter named "Sheet Number".
Its storage type is string.
<code>AsValueString</code> returns a blank value for it, whereas <code>AsString</code> returns "---":</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/asvaluestring_sheet_number.png" alt="Sheet number" width="600">
</center></p>
<p>Similarly for the Duct Accessory parameter "Loss Method":</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/asvaluestring_loss_method.png" alt="Loss method" width="600">
</center></p>
<p>The same problem occurs with many other element and parameters.</p>
<p>Is there a way to identify which value is correct and to identify which method to use to always to get the correct value?</p>
<p>I am running into the issue exporting schedule data to Excel. In some cases, I export a blank value for a non-blank data item.</p>
<p>When importing back the data, I cannot determine whether the user modified it or it was incorrectly exported.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Revit Parameter class has
a <a href="https://apidocs.co/apps/revit/2019/3dbebcb8-792b-a3dd-fe63-faaa05704f3c.htm">storage type</a> that
can take one of the following values:</p>
<ul>
<li>None &ndash; None represents an invalid storage type. This value should not be used.</li>
<li>Integer &ndash; The internal data is stored in the form of a signed 32-bit integer.</li>
<li>Double &ndash; The data will be stored internally in the form of an 8-byte floating point number.</li>
<li>String &ndash; The internal data will be stored in the form of a string of characters.</li>
<li>ElementId &ndash; The data type represents an element and is stored as the id of the element.</li>
</ul>
<p>Corresponding to the four valid storage types, there are four accessors to read the stored value from the database:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AsDouble</code> &ndash; Provides access to the double precision number within the parameter.</li>
<li><code>AsElementId</code> &ndash; Provides access to the Autodesk::Revit::DB::ElementId^ stored within the parameter.</li>
<li><code>AsInteger</code> &ndash; Provides access to the integer number within the parameter.</li>
<li><code>AsString</code> &ndash; Provides access to the string contents of the parameter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use those four, and you will have no problem.</p>
<p><code>AsValueString</code> is a completely different creature that returns the parameter value as a string with units, like the user would see it.</p>
<p>It may perform complex conversions while rendering the string.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a string-valued parameter value can only be retrieved using <code>AsString</code>, and <code>AsValueString</code> returns an empty string for it, as you already noticed.</p>
<p>I would avoid using <code>AsValueString</code> at all in your situation, and keep track of the parameter storage type as well as its value.</p>
