<h3>Revit Camera Settings, Project Plasma, DA4R and AI</h3>
<h4><a name="2"></a> Map Forge Viewer Camera back to Revit</h4>
<p>My colleague Eason Kang invested some research
in <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/map-forge-viewer-camera-back-revit">converting the camera state of the Forge Viewer back to the Revit model via Revit API</a>.</p>

<p>I am sure thus will prove very useful for anyone aiming to precisely adjust the camera settings in a Revit perspective view.</p>

<p>I have been rather silent lately on the topic
of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.55">DA4R, Design Automation for Revit</a>,
mainly due to the fact that my more Forge-focussed colleagues are dealing with that more than I am.</p>
<p>Mikako harada now also published her own overview
