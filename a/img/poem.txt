Left side:

Field mouse jumps between the branches, 
and makes the shadow of the moon wobble.

Right side: 

Spring ... 
A cow plows the field  
Nice smell fills the valley.

This poem describes the mouse, meaning the last year, and the cow, meaning this year, vividly. 
Hope you enjoy it!
