<h3>Kean on Reflector</h3>

<p>I repeatedly mentioned the topic of 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/converting-between-vb-and-c-and-net-decompilation.html">
converting between C# and VB</a>,

and how I use the 

<a href="http://www.red-gate.com/products/reflector">
Reflector</a>

tool for this task, for example to 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/05/vb-samples-and-other-questions.html#2">
convert Revit SDK samples</a>.

<p>If you are as keen on Reflector as I am, you will probably find Kean Wamsley's series on the new 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/02/debugging-into-autocads-net-api-layer-using-reflector-part-1.html">
Reflector pro</a>

version very interesting as well.
