Your Windows form is presumably not running as a modal form within a valid Revit API context.

Consequently, you are trying to access Revit and its API from outside. This is basically not possible. A workaround exists via the use of an [external event](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018/05089477-4612-35b2-81a2-89c4f44370ea.htm).

This issue is currently also being discussed in the [Revit API discussion forum](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread on [Revit API with WPF](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-with-wpf/m-p/8209618).

The official approach is presented in the Revit SDK sample ModelessDialog/ModelessForm_ExternalEvent.

using mvvm & wpf with transaction & doc.regenerate()
[Q]
i'm working on simple command
it have wpf form bonded to class as per mvvm methods
i call the wpf from my command and it show up using wpf,show();
i use the form and change data then click the buttom to run command on viewmodel from my form as usual in mvvm to pick the objects and change its data
i can close my form
when selecting the object after that i can see that parameter data has changed as i want but document can't fell that changes and i can't generate the document
my problem is i cant use transaction.start on my mvvm command and ca't regenerate the document to see the changes in the tags
how can i solve that?

It sounds as if your WPF form is not running as a modal form within a valid Revit API context.

<p>Today, let's pick up the recurring topic of accessing the Revit API from a modeless context.</p>
<p>It was discussed fruitfully in some depth in 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-with-wpf/m-p/8209618">Revit API with WPF</a>.</p>
<p>I'll skip most of the answer, because it is convoluted.</p>
<p>The most important aspect, though, is short and sweet:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/12/external-event-and-10-year-forum-anniversary.html#2">The Revit API cannot be used in a modeless context</a>.</p>
<p>It can only be used in a valid Revit API context.</p>
<p>A valid Revit API context is provided within the handlers executed by Revit call-backs, and nowhere else.</p>
<p>For instance,
an <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018/ad99887e-db50-bf8f-e4e6-2fb86082b5fb.htm">external command</a> defines
an <code>Execute</code> methods and registers itself with Revit.</p>
<p>Revit calls that method and supplies a valid Revit API context to it via its <code>ExternalCommandData</code> input argument.</p>
<p>A Windows form can be displayed either using <code>Show</code> or <code>ShowDialog</code>.</p>
<p>If you use <code>Show</code>, it becomes a modeless dialogue and all interaction which it is outside of any valid Revit API context.</p>
<p>If you use <code>ShowDialog</code>, it becomes modal and remains in the same thread that launched it, possibly inheriting a valid Revit API context.</p>
<p>If you happen to be in a modeless context, you can implement a solution to access a valid Revit API context by implementing
an <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018/05089477-4612-35b2-81a2-89c4f44370ea.htm">external event</a> and calling that.</p>
<p>Similarly to the external command, it also defines an <code>Execute</code> methods and registers itself with Revit.</p>
<p>Revit calls that method and supplies a valid Revit API context to it when it is prompted by an external trigger.</p>
<p>The official approach for implementing an external event is demonstrated by a Revit SDK sample:</p>
<ul>
<li>ModelessDialog/ModelessForm_ExternalEvent</li>
</ul>
<p>It may require some redesign of your application logic to use.</p>
<p>Ryan Singleton added some good real-world advice to this:</p>
<p>To add my experience to what Jeremy said (you need External Events to make your transactions work modelessly), I have built a dockable dialog with WPF that used a lot of external events. Autodesk recommends that you try to use modal dialogs as much as you can instead of modeless. It will make your project much easier.</p>
<p>However, I can tell you that a fully functional suite of tools with external events is possible. But you need to be sure that the added complexity is worth it.</p>
<p>If you are going to have multiple external events, I strongly recommend that you look at the Revit SDK sample for External Events specifically. It shows how to use enums and a handler to swap out external events so that you do not have a sloppy mess of external events in your application.</p>
<p>You can also have a modeless dialog that, when you press a button to start a transaction, will open a modal window (progress bar or some other window), and that window will start the transaction instead. Once done, it closes, and the user feels like they are using a modeless context. A system like that would be much easier to maintain.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Here are some other recent threads raising the same question:</p>
