<h3>Revit Future Direction and Public Roadmap</h3>
<p>Here I am in Munich, supporting the
one-week <a href="http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com">Forge accelerator</a> workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Pizza and Isar</a></li>

</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Pizza and Isar</h4>
<p>I am staying with a friend on the other side of the river, so I get a chance to cook in the evening:</p>

</center></p>
<p>I have a nice long walk to get to and from the office crossing the Isar River, taking me through a stretch of nature and greenery each evening and morning:</p>

</center></p>
<p>That feels good!</p>
<p>You can see a handful more pictures in
the <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHskKjyb4g">Pizza and Isar album</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Public Revit Roadmap</h4>
<p>I still have lots of exciting things to report from the
the <a href="http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2016eur">RTC Revit Technology Conference Europe</a> in
Porto last week.</p>
<p>Maybe the most relevant for the entire community is
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-roadmaps/the-first-ever-public-revit-roadmap/ba-p/6633199">public Revit roadmap</a>,
also accessible via <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/revitroadmap">www.autodesk.com/revitroadmap</a>,
published by Sasha Crotty, Product Manager in the Revit development team.</p>
<p>It sparked a huge amount of discussion already:</p>
<p>Maybe you would like to join it and make yourself heard as well?</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Revit Idea Station</h4>
<p>It also touches a lot on
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-ideas/idb-p/302/">Revit Idea Station</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-ideas/idb-p/302/">Revit Idea Station</a></li>
<li><a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/tag/API/tg-p/board-id/302">Tag: API</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/05/idea-station-and-textnote-bounding-box.html#2">Introducing the Revit Idea Station</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I mentioned the lively discussion on both of these topics in the notes from
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/10/rtc-revit-api-panel-idea-station-edit-and-continue.html">Revit API discussion panel</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Revit Today and Tomorrow</h4>
<p>Sasha herself presented the public roadmap and many exciting aspects of the future direction of Revit in her <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1mnxejZqmlEKX">20-minute RTC presentation on Revit Today and Tomorrow</a>.</p>
<p>There were so many exciting presentations at RTC!</p>
<p>I wish I could share them all with you!</p>
<p>Anyway, getting back to the roadmap:</p>
<p>Join the lively discussion going on right now!</p>
<p>Make yourself heard.</p>
