I did, and thank you again for providing this!

Would you like repeat it for Revit 2014 as well?

Or share the steps with us, so some other brave soul can step up for this challenge?

Thank you!

Cheers,

Jeremy

Hi,

Funnily enough I almost made a start on this the other day, but there has been some strange re-structuring of the Wiki help website which also includes wiping out the Revit 2013 portion by the looks of it…

Basically I sat there for many hours going from page to page, and copying and pasting from Internet Explorer to Word, then a bit of re-formatting to get rid of the dreaded Times New Roman font and then PDF’ing…

I find it better to paste into a Portrait A3 document, PDF it and then if I print any of it, I still print at A4, the text is still readable…

I might still have a go at the 2014 stuff, but my current window of availability has just closed, I’m going to be snowed under with work for the next week against a stiff deadline, but maybe after that if things calm down enough again…

Can anyone shed any light on what has happened to the 2013 wiki and if it is just temporary… I did post on here about it, but got little response…

Thanks for the Kudos...

Oh, no, how utterly horrible, man.

That sounds stupendously tedious and a heroic job, downright Herculean.

Multiply my thanks by a million, please.

I would suggest using a different apporach, e.g. Googling for something like "download website content".

One of the hits I see is this:

If it works, it will save you a significant amount of tedium and manual labour, and no need to worry about the restructuring.

Or look at using tools like jquery et al:

Hahaha I knew that there must have been a smarter way to go about it, but I had a machine with no install permissions for custom software, and a need for the info in pdf format so I could read it on my iPad while travelling and abiout a week of spare time between current projects finishing and me setting off to work abroad with little or no internet access to look forward to :smileyhappy:

I had PDF'd various chapters previously so I just extended the process... it was about 2/3 the way through I started regretting it, but it has been invaluable since.

I should look at automating the process though :smileyhappy: maybe my next challenge :smileyhappy:

Hi All,

Greetings from Sunny Bangkok :catvery-happy:

For those of you who are monitoring this feed, I have just uploaded the 2014 version of the document which can be found on the following post:

Click Me

http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/Revit-API/Revit-2014-Platform-Developer-Guidlines-in-PDF-Format/td-p/4629067

I hope you enjoy it and find at useful as I'm sure I will... I couldn't have managed without the 2013 version...

If you are interested, I did spend last weekend trying to figure out a way of Automating the process of collating this information, I did manage to write a VBA Macro in Word that navigated to the pages, and also figured out how to navigate the tree, but the bits that caught me out were controlling the output pdf name (I did manage to find a solution to print the page to a default printer). the other part of the problem was capturing the text styles without access to the css information. Surely the text formatting must exist on the client side somewhere...?

I put the project on the back-burner at that point and decided to hand-ball it again this weekend.

If anyone knows the answers to the above pieces of the puzzle and fancies teaming up to crack it for when 2015 comes out,  or if you can point me in the approximate direction then message me :smileyhappy:

Regards

Ian

Following the popularity of the PDF I created earlier in the year, I have finally managed to create a similar document for Revit 2014.

The document is 450 pages and contains the whole of the wiki-help "Developers" branch of the index tree.

You can download it from by Dropbox Account by using the following link.

If you are downloading this and if you find it useful, please exit via the gift shop and give me a Kudos.jpg.JPG thumbs up

I hope you find this offline version as useful as I do...?

Enjoy
