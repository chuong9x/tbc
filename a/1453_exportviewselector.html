Selecting RVT Views for Forge Translation #revitapi #3dwebcoder @AutodeskRevit @AutodeskForge #ForgeDevCon

By default, the SVF translation process for the Forge Viewer extracts and transmits all 2D views from a Revit RVT BIM project file, but only the standard "{3D}" view. This behaviour can be modified manually by installing A360 Collaboration for Revit (C4R), launching 'Views for A360' and selecting the desired additional views. How can I programmatically select which views are being extracted from a Revit document so they show up in the Forge Viewer?

<h3>Selecting Views for Forge Translation</h3>
<p>By default, the translation process for
the <a href="https://developer-autodesk.github.io">Forge Viewer</a> extracts
and transmits all 2D views from a Revit RVT BIM project file, but only the standard <code>"{3D}"</code> 3D view.</p>
<p>This behaviour can be modified manually by
installing <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2017/ENU/?guid=GUID-95DA7950-294A-442F-B82A-218E45D79C66">A360 Collaboration for Revit (C4R)</a>,
launching 'Views for A360' and selecting the desired additional views:</p>

</center></p>
<p>For the full details on this manual selection process, please refer to the explanation
on <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2015/09/how-to-export-multiple-3d-views-for-view-and-data-api.html">how to export multiple 3D views for View and Data API</a>.</p>
<p>In the background, the view selection command actually launches another add-in, the ExportViewSelectorAddin, typically installed in the folder  <i>C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\2017\ExportViewSelectorAddin</i>.</p>
<p>With this background information, we can address the following query:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there a way to programmatically select which views are being extracted from a Revit document so they show up in the Forge Viewer? </p>
<p>The A360 add-in mentioned above can do it by manually selecting the views for each document, but that is not a realistic approach for a large and complex project.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> External developers can write their own Revit add-in to programmatically select views by using <code>ExportViewSelectorAddin.dll</code>.</p>
<p>It is installed as part of the A360 Collaboration for Revit (C4R) package.</p>
<p>The view selection was just further enhanced to correctly handle views from the 'Structural Plans' section.</p>
<p>Check out the latest C4R update release and install the newest version of ExportViewSelectorAddin.dll.</p>
