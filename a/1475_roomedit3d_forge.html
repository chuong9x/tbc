<h3>Roomedit3d Broadcast, Teigha BIM and Forge Webinar 3</h3>
<p>My discussion with Philippe on
integrating <a href="https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-boilers.nodejs/tree/roomedit3d">roomedit3dv3</a> with the rest of
his <a href="https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-boilers.nodejs">Forge node.js boilerplate samples</a> continues, as does the Forge hackathon webinar series.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Open Design Alliance made an interesting Revit related announcement:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>REST vs WebSocket and Roomedit3dv3 Broadcast Architecture</h4>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/F3lipek">Philippe Leefsma</a> and I discussed how to communicate end user modifications made using the custom viewer extension back to the Revit add-in to update the BIM.</p>
<p>Philippe suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Putting all the code into a viewer extension to make it pretty easy to manage. I could add potentially useful features to my server if needed by your app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> In my previous architecture, I used REST to notify the server from the client, and <code>socket.io</code> from the server to the rest of the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Client viewer extension &rarr; REST &rarr; server &rarr; <code>socket.io</code> &rarr; desktop</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, I did not just add a pure client viewer extension, but also fiddled around in the server a bit as well.</p>
<p>Should I try to put the <code>socket.io</code> broadcast directly into the viewer extension, and avoid the extra communication step?</p>
<ul>
<li>Client viewer extension &rarr; <code>socket.io</code> &rarr; desktop</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the architecture implementation that I used successfully for that last time around:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/www/js/extensions/Roomedit3dTranslationTool.js">Viewer extension</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/www/js/roomedit3dapiclient.js">Client notification to server</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/routes/api/roomedit3d.js">Server broadcast request API endpoint</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d/blob/master/server.js#L54-L60">Server broadcast relay</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You have to go from client to server if you want to broadcast a message to other connected clients, but it seems like you don't need to handle any very specific logic on the server; basically the server can expose a generic REST endpoint which will receive a message and dispatch it to all other clients except the one that initiated the request.</p>
<p>The server already implements a <code>SocketSvc</code> socket service which we can use for that.</p>
<p>There are two options how this can be implemented:</p>
<ol>
<li>Similar to what you did last time: REST endpoint exposed by server, client calls POST with a payload containing message, server broadcast to all other clients.</li>
<li>Client uses socket to send message to server, server broadcasts message to all other clients.</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases I need to add a little piece of code to my server, so the feature is more generic than what you did last time. I will also add a SocketService on the client side, so it's easy to use.</p>
<p>Here is an illuminating read on a <a href="http://blog.arungupta.me/rest-vs-websocket-comparison-benchmarks">REST vs WebSocket comparison and benchmarks</a>.</p>
<p>Take a look at that and decide which is more suitable for your scenario.</p>
<p>Later: I just finished adding a thin wrapper around client side socket.</p>
<p>It is now wrapped in a 'service' making it avail application-wide through the client-side <code>ServiceManager</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
import ServiceManager from 'Services/SvcManager'

var svc = ServiceManager.getService('SocketSvc')

svc.broadcast('your-msg-id', {data...})
</pre>

<p>All other clients but the initiator will receive the message.</p>
<p>An example of using this is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-boilers.nodejs/blob/master/6%20-%20viewer%2Bserver%2Bdata-mng%2Bderivatives/src/client/App.js#L251">client App.js</a>.</p>
<p>Time for me to get going on implementing and using this, then.</p>
