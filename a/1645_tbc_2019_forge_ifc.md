### Forge RVT to IFC, ADN Xtra, TBC and AdnRme Updates

I already described how I installed Revit 2019,
[compiled the Revit 2019 SDK samples](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/compiling-the-revit-2019-sdk-samples.html)
and [migrated RevitLookup](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/revitlookup-2019-and-new-sdk-samples.html) to
the new version.

I now migrated some of the other basic samples and utilities and have some Forge news to share:

- [The Building Coder samples for Revit 2019](#2) 
- [The `AdnRme` MEP HVAC and electrical samples for Revit 2019](#3) 
- [AdnRevitApiLabsXtra for Revit 2019](#4) 
- [Convert RVT to IFC via Forge](#5)
- [Forge accelerators](#6) 
- [Forge webinars](#7)
- [Open Position for an Infrastructure BIM Implementation Consultant in Northern Europe](#8)


####<a name="2"></a>The Building Coder Samples for Revit 2019

The migration of [The Building Coder samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples) to
Revit 2019 was just as trivial as RevitLookup.

- Update the .NET framework target version to 4.7
- Point the Revit API assembly references to the new DLLs.

No code changes were needed.

That does generate [six warning messages about deprecated Revit API usage](zip/tbc_samples_2019_errors_warnings_1.txt).

They all occur in the module `CmdGetMaterials.cs` and concern the use of the `AssetProperties` `[]` operator taking integer and string arguments, e.g.:

- warning CS0618: 'AssetProperties.this[int]' is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2019 and will be removed in the next version of Revit. We suggest you use the 'FindByName(String)' or 'Get(int)' method instead.

I will ignore them for the time being.

The flat migrated version is [releases 2019.0.138.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2019.0.138.0).

The [diff between 2019.0.138.0 and 2019.0.138.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/compare/2018.0.138.4...2019.0.138.0) shows
the minimal changes I made.

To add the final finishing touch, I also updated the readme file with new Revit and .NET framework version badges.

The current version is [2019.0.138.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2019.0.138.1).


####<a name="3"></a>The AdnRme MEP HVAC and Electrical Samples for Revit 2019

Similarly, I updated the [AdnRme MEP HVAC and electrical samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme) for Revit 2019.

The flat migration is captured in [release 2019.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2019.0.0.0), 
and I added badges here as well in [release 2019.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2019.0.0.1).


####<a name="4"></a>AdnRevitApiLabsXtra for Revit 2019

Next, I migrated the [AdnRevitApiLabsXtra](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra) with similar ease.

No code changes required &ndash; again, just updated the .NET framework version and the Revit API assembly DLL references.

The current version is [2019.0.0.1](https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2019.0.0.1).


####<a name="5"></a>Convert RVT to IFC via Forge

Looking toward the future making use of web-based component technology,
[Simon Moreau](https://github.com/simonmoreau) of [Bouygues Immobilier], author of the [BIM42 blog](http://bim42.com),
shared his nice new [RevitToIFC web app](https://github.com/simonmoreau/RevitToIFC).

Revit To IFC is a web application using
the [Autodesk Forge](https://autodesk-forge.github.io) web
services to convert Revit file to the IFC format.
You can use it to upload a Revit file to Forge and download back the resulting converted file.

####<a name="6"></a>Forge Accelerators

Does this inspire you to want to get started with Forge yourself?

An easy way to do so is to attend a [Forge accelerator](http://autodeskcloudaccelerator.com/forge-accelerator).

The upcoming ones are here:

- Boston, USA &ndash; April 30 - May 4
- Bengaluru, India &ndash; May 7-10
- Barcelona, Spain &ndash; June 11-15
- San Francisco, USA &ndash; June 18-22
- Sydney, Australia &ndash; July 9-12

####<a name="7"></a>Forge Webinars

Two upcoming Forge webinars are dedicated to more bleeding edge technology, HFDM &ndash; High Frequency Data Management &ndash; and the new app framework:

- 2018-04-26, 8.00 AM PST, 90 minutes
&ndash; [The Future of Making Things on Forge: Sneak Peek at Forge NextGen (HFDM & App Framework)](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8209398405782333955)
- 2018-05-09, 8.00 AM PST, 90 minutes
&ndash; [A technical introduction to Forge High Frequency Data Management (HFDM) SDK and Forge App Framework](https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/3624195224359611394)

You might also want to check out the recording on the topic from the Forge DevCon 2017 class at Autodesk University,
