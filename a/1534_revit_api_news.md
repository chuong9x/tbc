### RevitLookup and DevDays Online API News

Lots of exciting information to share with you today, unprecedented!

Just as in previous years, we held a series of worldwide DevDays conference series in the last few months, including at Autodesk University in Las Vegas.

Also, as in previous years, we presented the same information online in the past couple of weeks.

For the first time ever, this year, recordings of these presentations are made publicly available before the official public product release and end of the information embargo.

I extracted the section on the Revit API and hosted it separately in order to enhance it with a table of contents.

Furthermore, we are proud to present another little update of the revamped version of RevitLookup:

- [Forward-looking DevDays Online API news](#2)
- [Revit API news for the next major release](#3)
- [Revit API news slide deck contents](#4)
    - [Must do](#5)
    - [New functionality](#6)
    - [Revit roadmap](#7)
- [RevitLookup enhancements](#8)

#### <a name="3"></a>Revit API News for The Next Major Release

As said, I extracted and slightly edited the Revit API news portion of the DevDays Online recording, skipping the Civil 3D and Infraworks portion and adding a table of contents for easier navigation.

Here is the link to that, plus the supporting material:

- [Revit API News DevDays Online webinar recording](https://adn.autodesk.io/uploads/file/revit_2018_api_news/index.html) with TOC

#### <a name="7"></a>Revit API News &ndash; Revit Roadmap

- Public Revit roadmap at [www.autodesk.com/revitroadmap](http://www.autodesk.com/revitroadmap) &ndash; Last month, we launched a new platform for you to share and talk with Autodesk about the future of Revit.  Revit ideas is a forum where you can submit, vote and comment on product improvements. Already, we have about 800 ideas from customer like you and thousands of votes.   Our team is investigating a number of ideas right now.  Other products have done this for a while, and I am glad to say that Revit is now part of the party.  The product team will be there listening and responding to items as they become popular.  Help us drive the direction of Revit and get your voice heard.

#### <a name="8"></a>RevitLookup Enhancements

Finally, to round off this exciting forward-looking excursion with something down to earth right here and now, our irreplaceable Revit BIM database exploration
tool [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) has
been significantly restructured in the past few weeks to use `Reflection` and reduce code duplication:

- [Using `Reflection` for cross-version compatibility](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/revitlookup-using-reflection-for-cross-version-compatibility.html)
- [Basic clean-up of the new version](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/revitlookup-with-reflection-cleanup.html)
- [Restore access to extensible storage data](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/02/revitlookup-extensible-storage-restored.html#3)

After adding the latter fixes related to extensible storage,
Alexander Ignatovich, [@CADBIMDeveloper](https://github.com/CADBIMDeveloper), aka Александр Игнатович,
submitted a couple of further enhancements in his pull request #27
to [restore category `BuiltInCategory`, watch properties with nullable<double> type and fix empty lists](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/27/commits):

- Restore ability to see category `BuiltInCategory` enum value
- Add ability to see nullable double values in property, e.g., for `Dimension.Value`
- Display empty list in non-bold and prevent drilling down into
- Remove code duplication

Many thanks to Alexander for these improvements!

I integrated them 
into [RevitLookup release 2017.0.0.18](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.18).

The most up-to-date version is always provided in the master branch of 
the [RevitLookup GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup).

If you would like to access any part of the functionality that was removed when switching to the `Reflection` based approach, please grab it
from [release 2017.0.0.13](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.13) or earlier.

I am also happy to restore any other code that was removed and that you would like preserved.
Simply create a pull request for that, explain your need and motivation, and I will gladly merge it back again.
