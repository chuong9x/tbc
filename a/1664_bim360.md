### Forge for AEC and BIM360 Overview

I am participating in a *Digital Contruction Day* in the UK next week and presenting there on Forge for the BIM domain.

In preparation, I'll jot down some notes here on what I learned about this myself lately:




####<a name="2"></a>Forge for AEC in Five Minutes

A good first impression of the Forge aspect of things is provided by Jim Quanci, Senior Director Forge Partner Development,
presenting [Forge for AEC in 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/BLHzTh_NsFM) [[^](/a/doc/forge/bam/video/forge_for_aec_in_5_minutes.mkv)].
  
As he says in the byline, Forge is a set of web service APIs that power the future of making things.

####<a name="3"></a>BIM 360 Overview

I started out at [bim360.autodesk.com](https://bim360.autodesk.com) and learned this:

- For Project Teams &ndash; BIM 360 is the single cloud platform that supports informed decision-making through the project lifecycle, leading to more predictable and profitable outcomes. Connect teams and collaborate on shared designs with BIM 360, the next-generation project delivery and construction management platform.

- For Design Teams &ndash; Connect teams and collaborate on shared designs with BIM 360, the next-generation project delivery and construction management platform.
- For Construction Teams &ndash; Make better decisions and eliminate costly delays with BIM 360, the next-generation project delivery and construction management platform.

Manage the entire project lifecycle with BIM 360

BIM 360 improves construction project delivery by supporting informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle. From design collaboration, documentation and reviews, to pre-construction, and through quality and safety and operations, BIM 360 connects the people, data and workflows on your project. So you can see the big picture and keep your projects on track.

- Controlled Worksharing &ndash; 
Control cloud-based Revit worksharing so the right user has the right access to the right design data at the right time.	
- Deliverable Coordination &ndash; 
Facilitate efficient BIM management and coordinate project progress, so you can successfully reach project milestones.	
- Design Review &ndash;
Publish, view, markup and share comments with a single application for design review.
- BIM Coordination &ndash; 
Automate BIM coordination processes to make it quicker to identify and resolve problems between disciplines.	
- Change Visualization &ndash; 
Understand changes between model versions when extended teams models are aggregated in a single coordination space.	
- Quality Management &ndash; 
Standardize quality workflows to gain visibility into all project issues, and quickly assign and resolve those issues.	
- Safety &ndash; 
Get safety program checklists and site observations into everyone’s hands to avoid safety blind spots.	
- Issue Management &ndash; 
Identify issues in the context of designs, assign work, and track issue resolution through inspection and completion.	
- RFIs and Submittals &ndash; 
Create, manage, distribute and approve submittals packages with tight project controls and activity tracking.	

All this BIM 360 functionality is provided to the end user by the various packages, so let's take a look at those now.

####<a name="3"></a>BIM 360 Package Overview

Here is a brief set of six succinct slides presenting a [BIM 360 Package Overview](zip/bim_360_packages_2018.pdf).


[BIM 360 Docs pricing](https://bim360.autodesk.com/docs-pricing)


[CONNECT THE DOCS: BIM 360](https://projectdelivery.autodesk.com/blog/connect-the-docs-bim-360/)

BIM 360 is Autodesk’s cloud and mobile platform for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) Industry. The platform currently consists of 7 products that span from conceptual design to construction to commissioning and handover, and even extending into operations:

- Docs
- Field
- Glue
- Layout
- Ops
- Plan
- Team

Because the BIM 360 platform is a cloud-based common data environment, you can exchange project data between products without cumbersome exports or time-consuming steps. You can even share this same data instantly across your team via a web browser or on mobile device in the field.

While there are seven offerings in the platform, it doesn’t mean that you need to be using all of them, as they each have their own place within the AEC project lifecycle.

This graph shows where each of the seven BIM 360 solutions can be used to connect stakeholders to project information throughout the entire AEC project lifecycle:

Design collaboration with BIM 360

Take a product like BIM 360 Team, that is purpose-built to alleviate many common issues associated with collaboration and document management in the design phase. This is done by keeping all project data in one location, and allowing anytime, anywhere, access through its cloud database. You can view, share, and markup over 50 2D and 3D design file types right in your browser.

Another feature is the ability for those on the team that aren’t Revit savvy to view and interact with Revit files in the 3D viewer. These interactions can include markups and notes, and are all captured and tracked within the project history, easily accessed from your mobile device.

Of course, there is more to BIM 360 Team as a standalone product than just these few things, but it is also the backbone and central repository for Autodesk’s cloud-based Revit model co-authoring service Collaboration for Revit, affectionately known as “C4R”.

While Collaboration for Revit is not a BIM 360 product, it’s worth mentioning because of its relationship to BIM 360 Team. C4R allows design teams that work in different offices, or different firms to work together on a common Revit project. With it being a cloud-based solution it removes costly IT hardware and setup allowing design teams to get right to work, while taking advantage of all the benefits of its BIM 360 Team backbone.

View, share, and markup 3D files in your browser in BIM 360 Team. Together with Collaboration for Revit, you can co-author 3D Revit models from any location or firm without a complex server setup.

Extending documentation into the field
Screenshot of BIM 360 Layout in iPadAnother interesting product that works with a BIM 360 sidekick is BIM 360 Layout. This solution helps to modernize and digitize the field layout process by extending the benefits of BIM 360 Glue. Layout is a free iPad app for BIM 360 Glue subscribers that allows you to take layout points from your model into the field via Glue, where you can use that same iPad to control a robotic total station to execute the field layout process. But it doesn’t stop there! We can also use the Layout app for QA/QC to verify job site locations, or to collect as-built data.

If what you have read so far has piqued your interest, there is still time to register for this year’s Autodesk University in Las Vegas.
