### Forge for AEC and BIM360 Overview

I am participating in a *Digital Contruction Day* in the UK next week and presenting there on Forge for the BIM domain.

In preparation, I'll jot down some notes here on what I learned about this myself lately:

####<a name="2"></a>Forge for AEC in Five Minutes

A good first impression of the Forge aspect of things is provided by Jim Quanci, Senior Director Forge Partner Development,
presenting [Forge for AEC in 5 minutes](https://youtu.be/BLHzTh_NsFM) [[^](/a/doc/forge/bam/video/forge_for_aec_in_5_minutes.mkv)].
  
As he says in the byline, Forge is a set of web service APIs that power the future of making things.

I started out at [bim360.autodesk.com](https://bim360.autodesk.com) and learned this:

- For Project Teams &ndash; BIM 360 is the single cloud platform that supports informed decision-making through the project lifecycle, leading to more predictable and profitable outcomes. Connect teams and collaborate on shared designs with BIM 360, the next-generation project delivery and construction management platform.

- For Design Teams &ndash; Connect teams and collaborate on shared designs with BIM 360, the next-generation project delivery and construction management platform.
- For Construction Teams &ndash; Make better decisions and eliminate costly delays with BIM 360, the next-generation project delivery and construction management platform.

Manage the entire project lifecycle with BIM 360

BIM 360 improves construction project delivery by supporting informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle. From design collaboration, documentation and reviews, to pre-construction, and through quality and safety and operations, BIM 360 connects the people, data and workflows on your project. So you can see the big picture and keep your projects on track.

- Controlled Worksharing &ndash; 
Control cloud-based Revit worksharing so the right user has the right access to the right design data at the right time.	
- Deliverable Coordination &ndash; 
Facilitate efficient BIM management and coordinate project progress, so you can successfully reach project milestones.	
- Design Review &ndash;
Publish, view, markup and share comments with a single application for design review.
- BIM Coordination &ndash; 
Automate BIM coordination processes to make it quicker to identify and resolve problems between disciplines.	
- Change Visualization &ndash; 
Understand changes between model versions when extended teams models are aggregated in a single coordination space.	
- Quality Management &ndash; 
Standardize quality workflows to gain visibility into all project issues, and quickly assign and resolve those issues.	
- Safety &ndash; 
Get safety program checklists and site observations into everyoneâ€™s hands to avoid safety blind spots.	
- Issue Management &ndash; 
Identify issues in the context of designs, assign work, and track issue resolution through inspection and completion.	
- RFIs and Submittals &ndash; 
Create, manage, distribute and approve submittals packages with tight project controls and activity tracking.	

All this BIM 360 functionality is provided to the end user by the various packages, so let's take a look at those now.
