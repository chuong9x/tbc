### Forge DevCon in Darmstadt and Las Vegas

I am making my last preparations for going to DevCon Europe in Darmstadt next week; DevCon Asia took place in Tokyo in August, and DevCon for the rest of the universe is coming up next month:

- [DevCon Europe at AU Germany in Darmstadt](#2) 
- [DevCon at Autodesk University in Las Vegas](#3)

As I [mentioned last month](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/devcon-europe-and-typepad-versus-google-search.html#2),
I will be attending the Forge DevCon Europe next week,
the second European edition of the [Forge DevCon](https://forge.autodesk.com/devcon-2018).

It is being held in Darmstadt on Tuesday, October 16th, the day before this year’s AU Germany on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
This is a free, English-language event where you can learn all about the capabilities that are currently (and soon will be) available through the Forge platform (the entire DevCon event is in English language, whereas the Autodesk University following it is in German).

You can still [register via this link](https://www.rayseven.com/r7/runtime/autodesk/devcon2018/registration.visitor.php).

For more details and reasons to attend, please [refer to the previous post](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/09/devcon-europe-and-typepad-versus-google-search.html#2).

The next exciting event is coming up just one month later,
the [Forge DevCon](https://au.autodesk.com/las-vegas/forge-devcon)

AU is taking place November 13-15, and the DevCon at AU is the day before, on Monday, November 12.
