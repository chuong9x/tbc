<h3>Revit 2012 WikiHelp Overview</h3>

<p>Here is a product related news item, although obviously of interest to developers as well.

<p>Revit product help has been 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html">
available on the web</a> for 

a while now, which provides a number of 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-help.html">
benefits</a>.

<p>Some 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/08/online-revit-api-help.html ">
online Revit API help</a> is

also available, although the full Revit SDK documentation is not there yet.

<p>Now the product help system has taken the next step by moving to a 

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">
wiki-based system</a> which provides support for a full community learning experience.

<p>Here is a

<a href="zip/Revit 2012 WikiHelp Overview.pptx">
Revit 2012 WikiHelp overview</a> which 

includes a summary of WikiHelp features and benefits, highlights key features and lists the benefits of this new community platform.

<!--
<p>The first time I started up Revit 2012, I could not find all the help information I was used to seeing. 
That was just a temporary glitch and the 2012 content is now fully indexed and every bit as complete as for 2011.
