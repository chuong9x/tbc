- [Purge unused materials](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2016/10/21/purge-unused-materials-for-another-rtceur-api-wish)

- [Q] I am interested in knowing the Revit family instances that are contained in a room. Apparently, Revit Rooms are currently not handled by the Revit to Forge translation. For a near term workaround, do you know of a Revit plug-in or script that generates a spreadsheet to report for each room in a model, the family instances contained by the room?  I heard the Revit API's support this, but have not seen or verified it.  The spreadsheet could be as simple as a three column table that lists Room ID, Room Name, and Family Instance ID, where the ID is the Revit Element ID.
[A] Sure; look at my [RoomEditoreApp](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp), in the module [CmdUploadRooms]()  implementing the external command to upload the room data to my cloud ddatbase. The [lines ]() implement code to retrieve the furniture and equipment contained in given room.

<h4><a name="2"></a>ForgeFader User Interface</h4>
<p>Yesterday, I mentioned the
new <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/forgefader">ForgeFader</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/Rvtfader">RvtFader</a> samples
to calculate and display a 'heat map', i.e. colour gradient, representing the signal loss caused by the distance and number of walls between the signal source and target points spread throughout a building using JavaScript
and <a href="https://threejs.org">three.js</a> and the Revit API, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FAUVELCyrille">Cyrille Fauvel</a> implemented
the shaders displaying the calculated colour gradient texture in the Forge model, 
and <a href="https://twitter.com/F3lipek">Philippe Leefsma‚Äè</a> added a neat user interface to control the attenuation values, grid density, and turn on and off the display of the raycasting rays:</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a>RevitLookup Builds</h4>
<p>Do you use <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a>?</p>
<p>If not, you might be best off to stop whatever you are doing right now and install and test it first.</p>
<p>You will not regret.</p>
<p>It is simply an interactive Revit BIM database exploration tool to view and navigate element properties and relationships.</p>
<p>Peter Hirn of <a href="https://www.buildinformed.com">Build Informed GmbH</a> very kindly set up a
public <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI</a> for RevitLookup
at <a href="https://lookupbuilds.com">lookupbuilds.com</a>
using <a href="https://jenkins.io/index.html">Jenkins</a> in
a multi-branch project configuration to build all branches and tags from the GitHub repository.
The output is dual-signed with the Build Informed certificate, zipped and published to an Amazon S3 bucket.

<h4><a name="4"></a>Purging Types, Families and Materials</h4>
<p>The Revit API provides no direct access to purge, and this has been high on the add-in developer wish list for a long time, cf. the discussions
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/purge-unused-text-note-types.html">purging unused text note types</a> 
and <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/determining-purgeable-elements.html">determining purgeable elements</a> in general.</p>
<p>Now, Harry Mattison of <a href="https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com">Boost your BIM</a> provided clever solutions
to <a href="https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2016/10/20/rtceur-api-wish-1-purging-types-and-families">purge types and families</a>
and <a href="https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2016/10/21/purge-unused-materials-for-another-rtceur-api-wish">purge unused materials</a>.</p>
<p>The former needs to handle and roll back if an error occurs due to attempting to delete the last type in a system family.</p>
<p>The latter uses the <code>DocumentChanged</code> event, rolling back transaction groups, and other good things do find materials that can be deleted without elements being modified.
It takes a bit of time to run because it is deleting all materials and undoing the deletions that modify other elements.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Harry for implementing and sharing these long-standing wishes!</p>
