  RE: Revit 2018 Print/Export API - API General - Revit Preview
  https://beta.autodesk.com/r/?6d997bdadada4533a0b998dd2dcc6b9a
  Revit crashes on exporting and printing most sheets if there is a modal dialogue open.  This worked on all previous versions of Revit...
  adn case 12894987 [Revit crashes when exporting / printing Sheets via API while a modal dialog is open]
  REVIT-112605 [RVT 2018 crash involving DWF, shaded views and Windows explorer -- 12919761] 
  REVIT-112607 [Revit crashes when exporting / printing Sheets via API while a modal dialog is open -- 12894987]

  To reproduce...
1. Open the rac_basic_sample_project.rvt project that is installed with Revit 2018
2. Go to Add-Ins > Export Crash Sample > Open Window
3. Click Export or Print
The sample project is specifically printing / exporting sheet A101, but I'm seeing the issue on just about every sheet in that project.
I've only seen the crash handling dialog once and I submitted the report (CER_146767270).  Every other time I get the Windows dialog saying Revit has stopped working.
I reviewed the CERs that you have reported (Thanks for submitting them!). Unfortunately, it looks like you are hitting a licensing issue that can occur when the software cannot establish communication with the Autodesk licensing servers. We are currently working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. We do apologize for the inconvenience!
REVIT-112150
REVIT-112561
The issue is not addressed in the 2018.0.1 release coming out today.

Here is just a quick note to begin the week with the good news that the Revit 2018 issue reported in the Revit API discussion forum thread on Revit 2018, DWF, shaded views, and Windows explorer bug is resolved by the hotfix to handle the product crash when communicating with licensing server. It can apparently also occur when exporting or printing views...
