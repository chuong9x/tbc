<h3>MEP Sample Code for Revit 2012</h3>

<p>One of my sessions at 

<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=e2011">
Autodesk University 2011</a> is 

<b>CP4453</b> Everything in Place with Revit MEP Programming.
It will cover both the new 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/06/the-revit-mep-2012-api.html">
Revit MEP 2012 API features</a> and

the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/09/the-revit-mep-api.html">
Revit MEP API in general</a>.

<p>In preparation for that, as well as preparing new samples, e.g. on 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/mep-placeholders.html">
placeholder elements</a>,

I am also updating the existing material, especially the ADN Revit MEP sample code.

<p>The old Revit 2011 material from AU 2010 is available online, for instance from the list of all sessions in the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/the-revit-api-track-at-au-2010.html">
Revit API track at AU 2010</a> and

for Revit MEP from my

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/11/autodesk-university-2010-class-materials.html">
Revit MEP 2011 API class materials</a>.

They are also available directly from the 

<a href="http://au.autodesk.com/?nd=event_class&session_id=6882&jid=620080">
CP316-3U All Systems Go in Autodesk Revit MEP Programming</a> page 

in the AU site itself.

<p>So, after all that retrospective introspection, here is 

<a href="zip/rme_src_2011-08-09.zip">rme_src_2011-08-09.zip</a> containing 

the flat migrated sample material for Revit MEP 2012. 
The descriptions of the features implemented provided by last year's handout material still apply.

<h4>Upcoming Revit API Training Classes</h4>

<p>There is still time to sign up to attend our classroom-based training sessions coming up this autumn. 
Please take a look at the 

<a href="http://www.adskconsulting.com/adn/cs/api_course_sched.php">API training schedule</a> and the

<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=785271">
course descriptions</a> to 

find out if you could benefit from attending one of these classes.
