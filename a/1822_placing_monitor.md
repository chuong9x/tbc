### Family Instance Placement Monitor

While writing the above, I also conversed with Kennan Chen of Shanghai
on [getting notified when a family type is about to be placed](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/get-notified-when-a-family-type-is-about-to-place/m-p/9327282).

He pointed out some interesting functionality that I was previously unaware of in UIFrameworkServices.dll:

**Question:** Is an event which can notify when Revit is about to place a family type?

There are events like `Application` `FamilyLoadedIntoDocument` and `FamilyLoadingIntoDocument`.

Is it possible to have another event `FamilyTypePlacingIntoDocument` for this?

Or is there a workaround?

**Answer:** As recently discussed, you
can [use the DocumentChanged event to detect the launching of a command](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/01/torsion-tools-command-event-and-info-in-da4r.html#3).

**Response:** It works great to catch the placing FamilyType event triggered by placing type directly from Revit UI.

The code I use:

Wow, how exciting to see my post in your blog. Lucky day ðŸ™‚

After hours of struggle, I finally end this up by simply using a Timer to constantly check the currently placing type until the UI refreshes and the API call returns correctly. It may not be the best solution, but at least it works.

I wrapped the logic up in the following class to make it easier. Hope this can be helpful. Pay more attention to the potential multi-thread risk and UI performance impact if someone wants to use the code.

Thank you for the appreciation. My pleasure entirely.

Wow, your FamilyPlacingMonitorService looks exciting.

I know little about the dispatcher and that stuff, so I hardly understand at all what you are doing.

Would you mid explaining step by step how this service works, for others not so experienced in this kind of stuff?

I would love to share this as well. I think many developers can learn a lot from it.

Thank you!

My pleasure to share this to people who are in need.

As a Chinese, I'm not quite good at explaining things in English. I'll try my best to be accurate. ðŸ˜›

I'll ignore the part how to get notified about a family symbol placing event.

Once the placing event is caught, the next job is to get the placing family symbol.

The core method is UIFrameworkServices.TypeSelectorService.getCurrentTypeId() from UIFrameworkServices.dll. This DLL ships with Revit, and can be easily found in Revit root folder.

I believe this method is designed for Revit UI framework to get data for the Properties panel, since every time this method is invoked, the returned value is always the id of the ElementType that is currently displayed in the Properties panel.

The biggest problem is, when a family symbol is to be placed, by API call or by UI click, this method doesn't return correctly. I guess the state doesn't change before Revit really enters placing mode. But when Revit enters placing mode, no code can be ran since the command loop in Revit is stuck. That's frustrating!

Luckily, another loop is still running, the message loop in every windows UI application running in STA mode. In WPF, the message loop is started by Dispatcher in the main UI thread. UI updates must be queued by dispatcher to be executed in the main UI thread synchronously. That's exactly the same mechanism adopted by Revit known as ExternalEvent. In the FamilyPlacingMonitorService class, method DispatcherInvoke tests whether the execution is currently in main UI thread. If not, it queues the delegate method to the UI thread.

To run code after Revit entering placing mode, a Timer is created ahead of time to constantly try to resolve the currently placing symbol. But the Timer doesn't run code in the UI thread, which means it's not safe for Revit API to run. The trick is to queue the Timer callback to the main UI thread using Dispatcher.

Every UI object (DispatcherObject specifically) holds a reference to the Dispatcher instance, it's easy to get that instance from the Ribbon object (Autodesk.Windows.ComponentManager.Ribbon).

I added some comments trying to explain the code clearly

            {
                //treat transactions with the name "Modify element attributes" as element placing
                //maybe not accurate, but enough to cover most scenes
                var document = e.GetDocument();

                //try to get the current placing family symbol
                if (ResolveCurrentlyPlacingFamilySymbol(document) is FamilySymbol familySymbol)
