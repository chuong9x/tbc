<h3>Handle Category Name Change</h3>

<p>Here is a little note I wrote sitting in Washington Dulles airport and did not get around to posting until now, to point out the importance of using language independent category comparisons:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Apparently at least one category name changed in the German version of Revit from 2009 to 2010: 

<ul>
<li>Revit 2009: "Tragende St&uuml;tzen" 
<li>Revit 2010: "Tragwerksst&uuml;tzen" 
</ul>

<p>We rely on category names for mapping purposes. 
In this case we discovered the change that was causing problems for us, but I am worried that there may be other similar changes that I also need to be aware of.
Is there any way to use a language independent identifier that will never change? 
I very much hope to find a way to identify categories in a language independent fashion.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can use the built-in category enumeration to make your code language independent when working with categories.
We looked at this and related topics in the discussions on 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/01/category-comparison.html">
category comparison</a> and

later explored it further for the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/category-comparison-and-model-element-selection-revisited.html">
model element selection</a>,

which we recently enhanced to 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/11/select-model-elements-2.html">
handle a set of multiple categories</a> using 

a list of built-in category enumeration values stored in _bics_to_skip and the helper method SkipThisBic to compare them all with a given value from a candidate element.
