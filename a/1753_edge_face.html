<h3>Secret Edges and Faces</h3>
<h4><a name="2"></a></h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> </p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Creating Connectors on a Reference Line</h4>
<p><a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3894260">MarryTookMyCoffe</a> points
out a surprising and useful possibility 
for <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/creating-connectors-on-reference-line/m-p/8707761">creating connectors on a reference line</a>:</p>
<p>I made some tests and thought I will share some of my results with the forum:</p>
<p>The problem with putting connectors on a reference line is that the API doesnâ€™t give us any references to any surfaces, no matter for what view we ask.</p>
<p>There is however a way to get around this one by by adding a secret suffix to the unique id and calling the <code>ParseFromStableRepresentation</code> method on it:</p>
<pre>
  Reference.ParseFromStableRepresentation(
    document, uniqueID );
</pre>

<p>With the right secret suffix, this can be used to retrieve a reference to a face on the reference line.</p>
<p>With lots of trial and error, we learned that the codes for specific faces will be always the same:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/create_connector_on_reference_line.png" alt="Creating connectors on a reference line" width="770">
</center></p>
<p>For example, let's look at this stable representation:</p>
<pre>
  3ded2a48-367f-42c7-83bd-9fd4f659891a-00000fd0:2
</pre>

<p>Here are the possibile secret suffixes in a table:</p>
<table>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">3ded2a48-367f-42c7-83bd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>-9fd4f659891a-00000fd0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>The Reference Line<br/>itself</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">:0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ref to line</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">:1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ref to solid</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">:2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ref to Face</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">:7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ref to Face</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">:12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ref to Face</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right">:17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>ref to Face</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The gaps between the numbers may seems strange, but I think that after every face, we have hidden edges of this face; what would explain the numeration.</p>
<p>[Q] Does that apply to each and every reference line?</p>
<p>[A] Yes, it applies to every reference line, always the same numbers.</p>
<p>[Q] So each reference line implicitly defines a solid and four faces?</p>
<p>[A] Faces are in the solid, but yes.</p>
<p>[Q] What solid is that?</p>
<p>[A] Similar to an extrusion, you can get a solid of the object with faces and lines, with the only difference that its faces don't have references. I guess the programmer forgot to set up this property.</p>
<p>[Q] Can you share a concrete use case for this?</p>
<p>[A] I use reference line with connectors in all fittings and accessories; that enables my family definition to work with minimal graphics. That way, you can easily define a family with low details (that is important in GB) and high details (that is important in Russia), without messing up how they work.</p>
<p>I plan to go even further and implement an auto-creation tool for fittings, accessories, and mechanical equipment. </p>
<p>The idea was to add to any family made on the market the same functionally that our families have &ndash; all you had to do was set length and type of connection, like: thread, pressed etc.</p>
<p>Very many thanks to MarryTookMyCoffe for sharing this valuable insight!</p>
