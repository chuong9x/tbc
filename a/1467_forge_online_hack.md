#### <a name="2"></a>Hackathon and Webinar Details
 
Are you thinking about developing on Autodesk Forge or Fusion 360?

Are you just interested in learning more about these technologies and what they can do to help your business and your career?

Join us for our upcoming free online hackathon and webinars.

This is our fourth online hackathon and you are welcome to participate in all or any part of it.
 
The [Autodesk App Store Forge and Fusion 360 Hackathon](http://autodeskforge.devpost.com) is an online event which consists of two segments:

- A series of web training and open Q&A sessions related to the Autodesk Forge platform and Fusion 360, open to anyone interested in learning about these APIs.
- An online hackathon where developers can develop new apps on the Forge platform or on Fusion 360 for submission to Autodesk App Store.
 
We know that learning and implementing something new takes time and often gets put off, so weâ€™ve designed this event to give you the support you need &ndash; as well as a financial incentive &ndash; to motivate you to learn the APIs and publish your app on the Forge platform or on Fusion 360 in the Autodesk App Store.
 
The training webinars help familiarize you with the Forge platform, and the open Q&A sessions provide the opportunity to receive help in real-time from the Autodesk team answering your questions to help you develop your app.

Webinars will be recorded so that you can view them at your convenience.

Autodesk Forge experts are at hand to help all along.

For all new apps submitted to the Autodesk App Store by midnight on October 31, 2016 and accepted for publication in the store by November 30, 2016, each entrant of the Hackathon will receive US$ 500 for one eligible app per entrant.
