When your hammer is C++, everything begins to look like a thumb.

An SQL query walks into a bar and sees two tables. He walks up to them and says 'Can I join you?'

To understand what recursion is, you must first understand recursion.
	
Q: Whats the object-oriented way to become wealthy?
A: Inheritance.

Q: how many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
A: none, that's a hardware problem.

####<a name="2"></a>Magic Number for Schedule Instance Bounding Box Margin

I discussed
the [ScheduleSheetInstance bounding box](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/schedulesheetinstance-bounding-box/m-p/7619803) 
with Alexander [@aignatovich](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1257478) Ignatovich in 
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160),
and the Revit development team confirmed the magic number he determined empirically for the hidden margin width:

**Question:** I am trying to place schedules to the view sheet in a vertical chain. The result should be something like:

<center>
<img src="img/ai_sibb_margin_target.png" alt="Target" width="470"/>
</center>

Actually, there are 2 (or more) schedules. I've already achieved what I want. I retrieve bounding box on active viewsheet of each ScheduleSheetInstance and move insertion point for each schedule.
 
The problem is that ScheduleSheetInstance bounding box is a bit larger than actual schedule table:

<center>
<img src="img/ai_sibb_margin_borders.png" alt="Borders" width="282"/>
</center>

I've draw borders with this Python shell code:

<pre class="prettyprint">
  shInst = selection[0] # a ScheduleSheetInstance should be selected to run this code
  
  bb = shInst.get_BoundingBox(doc.ActiveView)
  
  tx = Transaction(doc, "bounds")
  tx.Start()
  
  doc.Create.NewDetailCurve(doc.ActiveView,
    Line.CreateBound(bb.Min, XYZ(bb.Min.X, bb.Max.Y, 0)))
  doc.Create.NewDetailCurve(doc.ActiveView,
    Line.CreateBound(XYZ(bb.Min.X, bb.Max.Y, 0), bb.Max))
  doc.Create.NewDetailCurve(doc.ActiveView,
    Line.CreateBound(bb.Max, XYZ(bb.Max.X, bb.Min.Y, 0)))
  doc.Create.NewDetailCurve(doc.ActiveView,
    Line.CreateBound(XYZ(bb.Max.X, bb.Min.Y, 0), bb.Min))
  
  tx.Commit()
</pre>

The distance is ~2.12 mm. I hardcoded this value in my code. It seems it works, but I don't know if it works in every possible case.

So, the question is:
 
Is there any way to retrieve this value via API?

**Answer:** The development team confirm your current approach and provide the magic constant that you were looking for:

For a schedule instance in the sheet view, we add an invisible margin around the actual schedule table.

This margin will show up when selecting the schedule instance.

The margin width is a hardcoded value in the schedule code.

It is 1/12", which is around 2.12 mm.

Right now, there is no way to retrieve this value through API as it is not exposed yet.

I think it is safe to use this hardcoded value as it has been there and remained constant for years.

This is what the schedule instance margin looks like when selecting the schedule instance.

<center>
<img src="img/ai_sibb_margin_schedule_instance.png" alt="Schedule instances" width="316"/>
</center>

You can see that the move control and the drag height control are showing at the margin bounding box.


####<a name="3"></a>Using PostCommand with the Windows Automation API

[Fausto Mendez](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3909731) shared
a very nice example of using `PostCommand` in conjunction with
the [Windows Automation API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff486375.aspx) to
simulate user input to drive the Revit user interface programmatically in 
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [Revit links graphic overrides](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-links-graphic-overrides/m-p/7604332):

`PostCommand` enables you to launch the Revit command.

That displays an interactive form expecting manual user input.

That input can be provided programmatically as well, like this:

<pre class="code">
  RevitCommandId vgCmdId = RevitCommandId.LookupCommandId("ID_VIEW_CATEGORY_VISIBILITY");

  uidoc.Application.PostCommand(vgCmdId);
 
  Jrn.TabCtrl _
    "Modal , Visibility/Graphic Overrides for 3D View: 3D View And Sheets Start View , 0" _
    , "AFX_IDC_TAB_CONTROL" _
    , "Select" , "Revit Links"
  
  Jrn.Grid _
    "ChildControl; Page , Revit Links , Dialog_Revit_RvtLinkVisibility; ID_TREEGRID_GRID" _
    , "MoveCurrentCell" , "1" , "Halftone"
  
  Jrn.Grid _
    "ChildControl; Page , Revit Links , Dialog_Revit_RvtLinkVisibility; ID_TREEGRID_GRID" _
    , "PartialEdit" , "1" , "Halftone" , "Yes"
  
  Jrn.Grid _
    "ChildControl; Page , Revit Links , Dialog_Revit_RvtLinkVisibility; ID_TREEGRID_GRID" _
    , "MoveCurrentCell" , "1" , "Halftone"
  
  Jrn.PushButton _
    "Modal , Visibility/Graphic Overrides for 3D View: 3D View And Sheets Start View , 0" _
    , "OK, IDOK"
</pre>

Many thanks to Fausto for demonstrating this powerful approach!
