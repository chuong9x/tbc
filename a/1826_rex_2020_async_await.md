  A REX problem appeared in Revit 2019 and was resolved by sharing a custom version of the REX SDK.

It internally adopts an `ExternalEvent` creator, so the developers won't accidentally experience the context problems.
Hope it can be helpful to the community.

Re: Family related memory leaks 
A possible alternative is to run Revit in headless mode. Totally contrary to the documented approach to create an add-in, you can start an application which hosts a Revit runtime within the same process which enables you to do what you want with the top-level Application object. Just like Navisworks.

In your case, for each project, start a headless Revit to finish your process, then close the application.

The problem is, for each project, there is a waste of boot time.

Since headless Revit don't start the renderer and anything about the UI, less memory will be consumed to make it possible to run serveral tasks in parallel on your machine. Moreover you can even set up a cluster to handle tons of projects in parallel which I believe is the key to enable Forge to resolve Revit files in cloud.

As to how to set up a headless Revit, find a file named lcldrevit.dll or lcrvtutil.dll(newer version of Navisworks) under {Navisworks root folder}\Loaders\Rx folder. By decompiling that file,  LcRevitLoad.DoInit() contains all you need to start your own headless Revit.

To make things easy enough, I created a library called Revit.Headless to do all that loading logic for you. Visit https://github.com/KennanChan/Revit.Headless for more details. Also it's available via nuget.

### Another Async Await, REX and Structural Analysis SDK

#### <a name="2"></a> REX SDK and Structural Analysis SDK 2020

Last year,
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on an [issue with SDK and Visual Studio](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/issue-with-sdk-and-visual-studio/td-p/8052988)
poinbted out that the Visual Studio templates provided with the REX SDK to make use of the Revit Structure Extensions had not yet been updated for Revit 2019.

That was fixed by the development team and
an [updated set of REX SDK Visual Studio templates for Revit Structure 2019](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/06/rex-sdk-visual-studio-templates-for-revit-structure-2019.html#2) was
shared in the forum and here on the blog.

The same situation arose again with Revit 2020, and here are the updated templates, samples and documentation for Revit 2020:

- [REX SDK2020.ZIP](zip/REX SDK2020.ZIP)
- [Structural Analysis SDK2020.zip](Structural Analysis SDK2020.zip)

**Response:** The REX SDK installed and is now working!

I read all provided PDF documentation and did the Hello World exercise.
I have some basic questions on how to get started with my specific projects and will create a separate post for that when I'm ready. 

I haven't looked at the Structural Analysis SDK as we are going to link Revit with our own custom proprietary software.
After reading about element mapping between databases and the content generator, I'm relieved to know that the REX SDK will likely reduce a lot of development time since those functionalities already exist. 

Thank you for providing the updates! I'm glad to have begun my journey down this path.


#### <a name="3"></a> Revit.Async

Last month, we briefly looked at a
simple [`async` and `await` external event wrapper](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/02/external-communication-and-async-await-event-wrapper.html#2).

Kennan Chen kindly reacted to that post in a [comment](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/02/external-communication-and-async-await-event-wrapper.html#comment-4813648335),
saying:

[Revit.Async Github repositroy](https://github.com/KennanChan/Revit.Async) showing
how to use the task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP) to run Revit API code from any execution context.
Also available via nuget.

Kennan's implementation does indeed look very complete and impressive with extensive documentation in both English
and [Chinese](https://github.com/KennanChan/Revit.Async/blob/master/%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E.md):

#### <a name="3.2"></a> Revit.Async Background

If you have ever encountered a Revit API exception saying "Cannot execute Revit API outside of Revit API context",
typically when you want to execute Revit API code from a modeless window, you may need this library to save your life.

A common solution for this exception is to wrap the Revit API code using `IExternalEventHandler` and register the handler instance to Revit ahead of time to get a trigger (`ExternalEvent`).
To execute the handler, just raise the trigger from anywhere to queue the handler to the Revit command loop.
But there comes another problem.
After raising the trigger, within the same context, you have no idea when the handler will be executed and it's not easy to get some result generated from that handler.
If you do want to make this happen, you have to manually yield the control back to the calling context.

This solution looks quite similar to the mechanism of "Promise" if you are familiar with JavaScript ES6.
Actually we can achieve all the above logic by making use of task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP) which is generally known as `Task<T>` in .NET.
By adopting Revit.Async, it is possible to run Revit API code from any context, because internally Revit.Async wraps your code automatically with `IExternalEventHandler` and yields the return value to the calling context to make your invocation more natural.

If you are unfamiliar with the task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP), here is some useful material on it provided by Microsoft:

- [Task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP)
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/task-based-asynchronous-pattern-tap)
- [Task asynchronous programming model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/async/task-asynchronous-programming-model)

Here is a [diagram comparing the Revit API external event mechnism with Revit.Async](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sb6Yrlt6zjkE9XBh4UB5sWV_i8nTpkmG/view?usp=sharing) and screenshots of the two main parts:

## Define your own handler

Fed up with the weak `IExternalEventHandler` interface?
Use the `IGenericExternalEventHandler<TParameter,TResult>` interface instead.
It provides you with the ability to pass argument to a handler and receive result on complete.

It's always recommended to derive from the predefined abstract classes; they are designed to handle the argument passing and result returning part.

| Class                                                   | Description                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `AsyncGenericExternalEventHandler<TParameter, TResult>` | Use to execute asynchronous logic |
| `SyncGenericExternalEventHandler<TParameter, TResult>`  | Use to execute synchronize logic  |
