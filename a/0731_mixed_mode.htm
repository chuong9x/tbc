<h3>Mixed Mode C++ in Revit 2012</h3>

<p>Here is a short note to start the week, on an issue that arose a couple of times using mixed mode C++ development in Revit 2012.
This information was originally published on the members-only 

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/joinadn">
ADN web site</a> as 

a technical solution on the

development environment for mixed mode C++ for Revit 2012</a>:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a mixed mode C++ application. 
When I run it on a machine where no version of Visual Studio was ever installed, I see the following error message:

<p style="color:darkblue">Revit cannot run the external application "SimpleTest". 
<br>Contact the provider for assistance.
<br>System.IO.FileNotFoundException:
<br>Could not load file or assembly 'SimpleTest.dll' or one of its dependencies. 
The specified module could not be found.

<p>It seems as if some components that come with VS2010 are missing in the Revit installation. 
How can I solve this, please?

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Even though Revit 2012 uses the VS 2010 IDE and .NET 4.0, the native Revit code is compiled with the VS 2008 C++ compiler, and not with VS 2010. 
When an add-in makes use of unmanaged C++ code built with VS 2010 components, those components are not provided by the Revit installation. 

<p>There are two ways to solve this: you can either (1) set up your native C++ projects to use the VS 2008 compiler, or (2) install the VS 2010 redistributables yourself together with your add-in.
