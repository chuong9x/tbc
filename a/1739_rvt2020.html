<h3>The Revit 2020</h3>
<p>Happy Easter!</p>
<p><center>

</center></p>
<p>I've been too busy in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> to
blog properly.</p>
<p>Here are some quick notes anyway as an Easter present for you:</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a> RevitLookup for Revit 2020</h4>
<p>I migrated <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a> to Revit 2020.</p>
<p>No source code changes at all were required; I just changed the Revit API DLL assembly references and updated the readme file to
create  <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2020.0.0.0">RevitLookup release 2020.0.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, Harry Mattison of <a href="https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com">Boost your BIM</a> very
kindly provided a ready-built new installer in his post
on <a href="https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/revit-lookup-for-revit-2020">RevitLookup for Revit 2020</a>, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™ve added some conditional compilation and multiple configurations so that the single solution can be used to build against any version of Revit 2017-2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Revit 2020 SDK posted</h4>
<p>Last week, I described how
I <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html">installed the Revit 2020 SDK</a> from
the Revit 2020 installation <code>Setup.exe</code>
and <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html#8">set up RvtSamples</a> for it.</p>
<p>Now, in addition, the Revit 2020 SDK has also been posted to
the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit">Revit developer centre public web page</a>,
so you can access it from there independently of the Revit product installation.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> Generative Design with Philippe Starck</h4>
<p>Autodesk announced a
joint <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90334218/this-is-the-first-commercial-product-made-using-generative-design">collaboration of an algorithm with star designer Philippe Starck to create the first commercial product made using generative design</a>,
a chair that will soon go on sale:</p>

<p>I wish you easy sailing, much fun and success setting up and exploring Revit 2020 yourself!</p>
