<h3>How to Distinguish Redundant Rooms</h3>
<p>A couple of interesting Revit API issues were resolved during my recent absence.</p>
<p>Let's start with this question raised by Miroslav Schonauer and resolved by Diane Christoforo:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Using the terminology as shown in Schedules, I need to report all 'Not Placed', 'Redundant' and 'Not Enclosed' rooms.</p>
<p>I cannot rely on any particular schedule being present in the model.</p>
<p>So far, my research shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of these 3 'failure' cases have <code>.Area</code> as 0.</li>
<li>'Not Placed' additionally has <code>.Location</code> as null.</li>
</ul>
<p>The only remaining issue is how to distinguish between 'Redundant' and 'Not Enclosed' rooms.</p>
<p>Do you have any ideas how can I do this comprehensively and deterministically from the room properties and params?</p>
<p>BTW, I'm aware that an alternative approach would be via the Failure API. I can see, e.g., the enumeration value  <code>BuiltInFailures.RoomFailures.RoomNotEnclosed</code>.</p>
<p>After just reading about it and looking into some samples, I worry about this approach and think that it is possible to 'override' the failures, which may prevent me from determining whether the rooms really are Not Enclosed or Redundant.</p>
<p>Here is sample code illustrating the approach I have been able to develop so far:</p>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Distinguish 'Not Placed', 'Redundant' and 'Not Enclosed' rooms.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="blue">void</span> DistinguishRooms(
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">Document</span> doc,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ref</span> <span class="teal">StringBuilder</span> sb,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ref</span> <span class="blue">int</span> numErr,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ref</span> <span class="blue">int</span> numWarn )
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; sb = <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">StringBuilder</span>();
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">FilteredElementCollector</span> rooms
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">FilteredElementCollector</span>( doc );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; rooms.WherePasses( <span class="blue">new</span> <span class="teal">RoomFilter</span>() );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">foreach</span>( <span class="teal">Room</span> r <span class="blue">in</span> rooms )
&nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sb.AppendFormat( <span class="maroon">&quot;\r\n&nbsp; Room {0}:'{1}': &quot;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; r.Id.ToString(), r.Name );
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">if</span>( r.Area &gt; 0 ) <span class="green">// OK if having Area</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sb.AppendFormat( <span class="maroon">&quot;OK (A={0}[ft3])&quot;</span>, r.Area );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">else</span> <span class="blue">if</span>( <span class="blue">null</span> == r.Location ) <span class="green">// Unplaced if no Location</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sb.AppendFormat( <span class="maroon">&quot;UnPlaced (Location is null)&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">else</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sb.AppendFormat( <span class="maroon">&quot;NotEnclosed or Redundant &quot;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; + <span class="maroon">&quot;- how to distinguish?&quot;</span> );
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; &nbsp; }
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>Any ideas if this is possible?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Rooms that are redundant still have normal boundaries.</p>
<p>So you can call <code>Room.GetBoundarySegments</code> to test.</p>
<p>The list will be empty for a non-enclosed or unplaced room.</p>
<p>Jeremy adds: I added Miro's test method as <code>DistinguishRooms</code>
to <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples">The Building Coder samples</a> in
the module <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdListAllRooms.cs#L30-L65">CmdListAllRooms.cs</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Miro and Diane for the interesting question, research and answer.</p>
