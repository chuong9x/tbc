- blog:
  - use github as a blog base? via wiki?
  - open source blog platform?
  - keep in parallel with typepad tbc?
  - implement local url base for all links
  - clear out comments, email addresses and confidential stuff
  - put all blog source code on github

- blog on github

### tbc &ndash; The Building Coder Source and Index on GitHub

Developers frequently lament bad search functionality on Typepad-hosted blogs.

Furthermore, it is always handy to have an an offline local copy of any kind of important documentation you need to cansult.

With a local copy the The Building Coder source text, you can use your standard system tools to search and index locally in any form you like.

Finally, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple line-by-line index of all The Building Coder blog posts ever published?

I took these requirements into account right from the start when setting out
on [The 3D Web Coder](http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com),
as I explained in the discussion
on [hosting its source HTML and index on GitHub Pages](http://the3dwebcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/hosting-a-node-server-on-heroku-pages-and-3d-web.html#2).

I have obviously been pondering doing the same for The Building Coder ever since &ndash; well, actually, to tell the truth, I started thinking about that much earlier still.

Now I finally took the leap.

The entire source text for all posts ever published by The Building Coder is available online from the
new [tbc GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc).

It creates a GitHub-pages-hosted entry point
with [The Building Coder Index](https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a)
at [jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a](https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a).

You can also jump directly to [the table of contents at #6](https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a#6).

This is not a blog reading platform, it just provides a very handy public search and replication tool.

In case you wonder about the trailing `a` in this URL:
the reason for the additional 'a' subfolder is that GitHub sets a limit of 1000 to the number of files it lists in a single folder in the UI.

#### <a name="3"></a>GitHub Size Limitations

I hit a couple of limits built into GitHub and had to implement workarounds to handle some of them:

I already mentioned the limitation displaying no more than 1000 files per directory entry.

My blog posts currently number over 1400, so I exceed that, but can live with the situation as it is.


If you have more than 1000 files in one directory, some of the them are not displayed and you see a warning message saying "Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. XXX entries were omitted from the list":

<center>
<img src="img/github_directory_truncated_1000.png" alt="GitHub directory truncated to 1000 files" width="505">
</center>

Without the 'a' subfolder, the README.md in the top level folder was hidden by all the blog posts and therrefore not displayed.

The killer was that its contents were also not shown.

I added `a` to hold the blog posts and left [README.md](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/README.md) in the top-level directory.

A simpler issue occured with images and attachments.

They live in the two subfolders `img` and `zip`, respectively, currently weighing in at 225 and 410 MB in total size.

Luckily, all the indivisual image and attachment file sizes are smaller than 100 MB, or GitHub would refuse to host them at all.

As it is, I just got warning messages on two or three files that exceeded a threshold of 30 MB, but were still accepted.

The largest image file
is the 77-MB [monitor_progress.gif](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/a/img/monitor_progress.gif),
which is an animated GIF, i.e. a video screen recording, so not a still image at all.

The largest attachment is [track_changes.mp4](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc/blob/gh-pages/a/zip/track_changes.mp4),
another recording, 63 MB in size.


#### <a name="4"></a>Alternative Blogging Platforms

As you may be aware, my
colleague [Kean Walmsley](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/about-the-author.html) has
been thinking
of [moving his blog Through the nterface from Typepad to Wordpress](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/01/yet-another-blog-design-on-its-way.html) for
a while now.

He mentions that the killer feature of WordPress is search, considering that Typepad fails miserably on this count.

I think that I can fix that problem satisfactorily for all by making my entire blog source text available in this manner, and offer several additional benefits as well.

For a alternative blogging platform you might also be interested in reading
about [creating a beautiful and minimal blog using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole),
entirely avoiding blog servers like Typepad and WordPress, where you give up control over your data.

So all things considered, my current tendency is to keep the main blog staying put on Typepad.

The purpose of the GitHub version is not normal everyday reading, but safe backup and version management, providing full source access to all readers and a version that people can clone for local searching and offline access.

The [global index](https://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a) is just an additional perk.

I use the index file locally myself all the time, hundreds of times every day.


#### <a name="5"></a>Fork and Clone to Create your own Local Installation

To install your own local copy of The Building Coder, fork and clone the
repository [github.com/jeremytammik/tbc](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc) and
open `index.html` like this, with just two commands:

<pre>
/j/tmp/ $ git clone https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc
Cloning into 'tbc'...

/j/tmp/ $ open tbc/a/index.html
</pre>

Et voila, Bob's your uncle!

You have your own local copy ot The Building Coder on your system, including the full index and all source text.

Please be patient while cloning, because the entire package including images and attachments adds up to over 1 GB of data.

The layout is not in a nice blog format, of course. That is not its purpose.


#### <a name="6"></a>El Perro Semihundido by Goya

Let's end the week enjoying [Goya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Goya)'s [The Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dog_(Goya)) &ndash; *El Perro Semihundido* &ndash; painted on the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823, for his exclusive private enjoyment:
