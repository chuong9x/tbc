Creating a warning using the Failure API in the #RevitAPI @AutodeskRevit #bim #dynamobim @AutodeskForge #ForgeDevCon http://bit.ly/newwarning

The Failure API enables both failure definition and handling capabilities
&ndash; The ability to define and post failures from within API code when a user-visible problem has occurred
&ndash; The ability to respond to failures posted by Revit and by API code through code in your application
This also enables the creation of a modeless warning message to the user...

<h3>Creating a Warning Using the Failure API</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/04/failure-api.html">Failure API</a> was
introduced a long time ago, back in 2010, for Revit 2011.</p>
<p>Time enough to forget that it enables both failure definition and handling capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to define and post failures from within API code when a user-visible problem has occurred.</li>
<li>The ability to respond to failures posted by Revit and by API code through code in your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, Frank <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/2083518">@Fair59</a> Aarssen is
there to help and remind us, in his answer to 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-create-a-warning/m-p/8058817">how to create a warning</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I've a routine which moves elements around, but on some occasions, it comes across an element that can't be moved.</p>
<p>I can get the routine to filter them out, so it's not an issue, but I'd like to create a warning message for the user.</p>
<p>I can do this with the <code>TaskDialog</code> class, and it has rather a large number of options
&ndash; cf., the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra">Revit UI API labs in 2_Revit_UI_API</a> &ndash;
however, it cannot be used in a modeless manner, so it always stops the user and forces them to hit OK.</p>
<p>Really, I'd like to create a non-critical Warning message that warns the user, but does not stop them working &ndash; the same sort of warning you get if you delete a room from the model:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/warning.jpeg" alt="Warning" width="522"/>
</center></p>
<p>I can't see a way of creating this in the API &ndash; can it be done?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> For a non-Revit-API approach, you could indeed use a modeless Windows form and close it automatically after a specified time period. Here is a description
of <a href="https://drive-cad-with-code.blogspot.com/2014/02/showing-and-closing-modeless-formdialog.html">showing and closing modeless a form</a>.
It was written with AutoCAD in mind, and exceptionally applies to Revit as well, since it has nothing to do with either of them, really.</p>
<p>Much better, though, is to implement exactly what you ask: the Revit API does indeed provide complete support for creating your own modeless warning messages just like you require.</p>
<p>To do so, you can define your own failure, and let Revit display it.</p>
<p>First, you create a <code>FailureDefinitionId</code> and <code>FailureDefinition</code>:</p>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Create&nbsp;youw&nbsp;own&nbsp;new&nbsp;failure&nbsp;definition&nbsp;Ids</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Guid</span>&nbsp;guid1&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">Guid</span>(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;d0cf2412-08fe-476b-a6e6-e9a98583c52c&quot;</span>&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureDefinitionId</span>&nbsp;m_idWarning&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureDefinitionId</span>(&nbsp;guid1&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:green;">//&nbsp;Create&nbsp;failure&nbsp;definitions&nbsp;and&nbsp;add&nbsp;resolutions</span>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureDefinition</span>&nbsp;m_fdWarning&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureDefinition</span>.CreateFailureDefinition(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;m_idWarning,&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureSeverity</span>.Warning,&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;Textvalue&nbsp;is&nbsp;changed&nbsp;for&nbsp;all&nbsp;instances&nbsp;&quot;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span style="color:#a31515;">&quot;in&nbsp;textchain&quot;</span>&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;m_fdWarning.SetDefaultResolutionType(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureResolutionType</span>.SetValue&nbsp;);
</pre>

<p>Then, you can display the warning:</p>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureMessage</span>&nbsp;fm&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">new</span>&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">FailureMessage</span>(&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExternalApplication.m_idWarning&nbsp;);

&nbsp;&nbsp;doc.PostFailure(&nbsp;fm&nbsp;);
</pre>

<p>These steps are also demonstrated in the Revit SDK ErrorHandling and PerformanceAdviserControl samples, in the files Command.cs and FlippedDoorCheck.cs, respectively.</p>
<p>The failure is displayed as a Revit warning as depicted above.</p>
<p>You can totally ignore it, and continue working.</p>
<p>One possible caveat: it will probably be displayed when control reverts back to Revit (not sure).</p>
