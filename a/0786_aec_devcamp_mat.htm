<p>I presented some details from a number of the advanced Revit API session in my reports from 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/devcamp-day-one.html">
DevCamp day one</a> and

<p>In conjunction with the

getting started material</a> available from the 

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">Revit developer centre</a>,

this material just about touches on all important aspects of the Revit API.

<h4>ARCxl Detail Library</h4>

<p>I am normally not very concerned about Revit content, although that aspect is often of equal or greater importance than the API.

<p>Here is a little item that happened to catch my attention anyway:

<p>A 

<a href="http://www.arcxl.com/architects">
library of non-proprietary generic construction details</a> containing 

over 120,000 entries in native Revit, DWG and PDF file formats is now publicly available.
It was built in 2008-2009 to an agreed set of standards within a single office, providing consistency throughout. 
The library also includes over 1,000 Revit components to modify the details. 
Being provided in RFA, RFT and DWG format, the details and components can easily be modified.
