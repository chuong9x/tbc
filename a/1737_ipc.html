  Summary
  The Era of Connection is upon us.
  - An interface is a point where two systems, subjects, organizations, etc. meet and interact.
  - Forge APIs are like LEGO bricks, but your feet don't hurt when you step on them.
  - Forge is more than just APIs.
  - Forge is an ecosystem.
  - It's about developers, developers, developers.
  - Autodesk developers and non-Autodesk developers use the same APIs.
  - Customization is commonplace.
  - Forge is an industrial strength solution.
