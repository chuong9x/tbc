extension of the deadline</a>.

<p>I would like to join him in urging anyone who has not already submitted their wishes to do so as soon as possible:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FSEYSMJ86">AutoCAD Civil 3D</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FVZCJTCQN">Autodesk Inventor</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zoomerang.com/Survey/WEB22FRMLV62H3">Autodesk Navisworks</a></li>

</ul>

<p>The API wishlist survey with your feedback on your API needs has a strong influence on the direction of the future API, so please take the time to fill it out.

<p>Our engineering teams use this feedback to help prioritise the areas of API enhancements in coming releases. 
If you wish, you can leave your e-mail address and we will send you the final results when they become available.
