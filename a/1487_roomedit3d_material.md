### Connecting Desktop and Cloud RTC Material

I am in the last stages of preparing my presentation this afternoon on connecting the desktop and the cloud for 
the [RTC Revit Technology Conference Europe](http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2016eur).

For your and the audience's convenience, here are the materials I am presenting, and some of the main links to further information:

- [Handout](/a/doc/revit/rtc/2016/doc/s1_4_hand_connect_desktop_cloud_jtammik.pdf)
- [Slide deck](/a/doc/revit/rtc/2016/doc/s1_4_pres_connect_desktop_cloud_jtammik.pdf)

#### <a name="1"></a>Samples Connecting Desktop and Cloud

Here is a summary overview of the samples discussed.

Each consists of two components, a C# .NET Revit API desktop add-in and a web server.

Each of them lives in an own GitHub repository with its own documentation pointing to more detailed underlying research and implementation steps discussed in sequences of blog posts:

- [RoomEditorApp](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp) and the [roomeditdb](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit) CouchDB database and web server demonstrating real-time round-trip graphical editing of furniture family instance location and rotation plus textual editing of element properties in a simplified 2D SVG representation of the 3D BIM.
- [FireRatingCloud](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud) and the [fireratingdb](https://github.com/jeremytammik/firerating) node.js MongoDB web server demonstrating real-time round-trip editing of Revit element shared parameter values stored in a globally accessible mongolab-hosted db.
- [Roomedit3dApp](https://github.com/jeremytammik/Roomedit3dApp) and the first [roomedit3d](https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d) Forge Viewer extension demonstrating translation of BIM elements in the viewer and updating the Revit model in real time via a socket.io broadcast.
- [Roomedit3dv3](https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-boilers.nodejs/tree/roomedit3d),
the new Forge-based sample, a viewer extension to demonstrate translation of BIM element instances in the viewer and updating the Revit model in real time via a `socket.io` broadcast, adding the option to select any Revit model hosted on A360, again using the [Roomedit3dApp](https://github.com/jeremytammik/Roomedit3dApp) Revit add-in.
