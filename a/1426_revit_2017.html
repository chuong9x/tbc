<h3>Revit 2017, RevitLookup and SDK Samples</h3>
<p>Revit 2017 was released yesterday.</p>
<p>Here is the official Autodesk statement stating

</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Uninstalling Prior Versions and Cleaning the Registry</h4>
<p>It initially refused to install due either to me clicking around too fast or some remnants of the pre-release from the Windows registry:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/revit_2017_prior_version_installed.png" alt="Revit 2017 prior versionÂ installed" width="417">
</center></p>
<p>I resolved that after struggling a while to manually remove every trace of 'Revit 2017' from the Windows registry.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Dummy API assembly Folder for Compiling Samples</h4>
<p>The first thing I did was to compile the Revit SDK samples.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I compiled those last week, before installing Revit 2017.</p>
<p>In order to achieve that, I manually created a dummy placeholder folder <code>C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2017</code> and copied the Revit API assemblies into that:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Resolving Hiccups Compiling Revit 2017 SDK Samples</h4>
<p>I ran into a couple of minor issues compiling the Revit 2017 SDK samples.</p>
<p>I was able to resolve them all myself, and so can you.</p>
<p>I installed the SDK from the MSI file that I received internally:</p>
<pre>
  04/15/2016  11:29  307,387,758  REVIT_2017_SDK.msi
</pre>

<p>I set it up in the root folder <code>C:\a\lib\revit\2017\SDK</code>.</p>
<p>As always, the first thing I did was to set up a desktop shortcut to the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm in <code>C:\a\lib\revit\2017\SDK\RevitAPI.chm</code>, and I strongly recommend you do the same thing right away as well.</p>
<p>I simulated the installation of Revit 2017, which I had not yet installed, a <a href="#3">described above</a>, by copying the Revit API DLLs from the Kepler pre-release version to a manually created dummy folder <code>C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2017</code>.</p>
<p>I opened Visual Studio 2015, which required an initial some licencing and log-on procedure, since I had hardly ever used it before.</p>
<p>I loaded the Revit SDK samples solution file <code>C:\a\lib\revit\2017\SDK\Samples\SDKSamples.sln</code>.</p>
<p>Initially, <a href="zip/sdk_samples_2017_01.txt">lots of errors</a> occurred and four samples failed to build.</p>
<p>The first one that I took a closer look at was <code>BRepBuilderExample</code>.</p>
<p>It was trying to load the Revit API assemblies from a non-existent hint path <code>Releasex64</code> specified in BRepBuilderExample.csproj:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<span class="blue">&lt;</span><span class="maroon">Reference</span><span class="blue"> </span><span class="red">Include</span><span class="blue">=</span>&quot;<span class="blue">RevitAPI</span>&quot;<span class="blue">&gt;</span>
<span class="blue">&nbsp; &lt;</span><span class="maroon">HintPath</span><span class="blue">&gt;</span>..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Releasex64\RevitAPI.dll<span class="blue">&lt;/</span><span class="maroon">HintPath</span><span class="blue">&gt;</span>
<span class="blue">&lt;/</span><span class="maroon">Reference</span><span class="blue">&gt;</span>
<span class="blue">&lt;</span><span class="maroon">Reference</span><span class="blue"> </span><span class="red">Include</span><span class="blue">=</span>&quot;<span class="blue">RevitAPIUI</span>&quot;<span class="blue">&gt;</span>
<span class="blue">&nbsp; &lt;</span><span class="maroon">HintPath</span><span class="blue">&gt;</span>..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Releasex64\RevitAPIUI.dll<span class="blue">&lt;/</span><span class="maroon">HintPath</span><span class="blue">&gt;</span>
<span class="blue">&lt;/</span><span class="maroon">Reference</span><span class="blue">&gt;</span>
</pre>

<p>I fixed that by manually browsing to and re-referencing the DLLs and raised the issue REVIT-89864 [API sample BRepBuilderExample fails to compile] with the development team to have this fixed.</p>
<p>After successfully compiling BRepBuilderExample, <a href="zip/sdk_samples_2017_02.txt">CancelSave fails to compile</a>, because it requires RevitAddInUtility.dll.</p>
<p>My mistake, I had forgotten to copy it into my dummy DLL assembly folder:</p>
<pre>
&gt; copy "C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit Kepler\RevitAddInUtility.dll" "..\Revit 2017"
</pre>

<p>With CancelSave compiling successfully, the <a href="zip/sdk_samples_2017_03.txt">next error occurred in PlacementOptions</a>, which has a setting requiring all public members to be equipped with an XML documentation comment:</p>
<pre>
C:\...\PlacementOptions\CS\Command.cs(151,9,151,18): error CS1591: Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member 'PlacementOptionsEnum.FaceBased'

C:\...\PlacementOptions\CS\Command.cs(152,9,152,20): error CS1591: Missing XML comment for publicly visible type or member 'PlacementOptionsEnum.SketchBased'
</pre>

<p>I resolved that by adding the required comments and passed that on to the development team in REVIT-89865 [API: PlacementOptions Revit SDK sample compilation error]:</p>
<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> The placement options for user to place the family instance.</span>
&nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="blue">public</span> <span class="blue">enum</span> <span class="teal">PlacementOptionsEnum</span>
&nbsp; {
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Face based</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; FaceBased,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> Sketch based</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="gray">///</span><span class="green"> </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; SketchBased
&nbsp; }
</pre>

<p>Once that was completed, all samples compiled with <a href="zip/sdk_samples_2017_04.txt">zero errors and 15 warnings</a>:</p>

</span></p>
<p>I submitted one final request REVIT-89869 [API SDK samples: eliminate warning messages] to the development team to fix these warning messages as well, but did not look into them myself in more detail.</p>
<p>They are all trivial to eliminate, and all belong to one of two types:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSB3884: Could not find rule set file "Migrated rules for *.ruleset".</li>
<li>MSB3270: There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built "MSIL" and the processor architecture of the reference "RevitAPI", "AMD64"...</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually implemented a stand-alone tool two years ago to automatically fix the latter warning, the Architecture Mismatch Warning Disabler:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/processor-architecture-mismatch-warning.html">Processor Architecture Mismatch Warning and Key Hook</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Here is Visual Studio 2015 with all the 182 Revit 2017 SDK samples successfully compiled:</p>

<h4><a name="5"></a>RevitLookup for Revit 2017</h4>
<p>Actually, to tell the even deeper truth, on request from Remy and others, I
compiled <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup for Revit 2017</a> even
before touching the Revit SDK.</p>
<p>I mentioned that last week in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a>
in the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/off-topic-for-remy/m-p/5995280">off topic for Remy</a> thread.</p>
<p>At the time, I did not yet have Revit 2017 installed, so I did that also using the <a href="#3">dummy Revit API assembly container folder</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most up-to-date version provided in
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup GitHub repository</a> is now for Revit 2017,
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.2">release 2017.0.0.2</a>.</p>
<p>If you are interested in an earlier release of Revit, please grab the latest appropriate one from the
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases">release list</a>, e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2016.0.0.13">2016.0.0.13</a> for Revit 2016,
<a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2015.0.0.8">2015.0.0.8</a> for Revit 2015, etc.</p>
