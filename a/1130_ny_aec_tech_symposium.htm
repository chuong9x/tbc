<h3>No DevCamp &ndash; Better &ndash; NY AEC Technology Symposium</h3>

<p>I have some good news and some bad news for you.</p>

<p>The good news is that Autodesk and ADN will be supporting the

<a href="http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014">
AEC Technology Symposium</a> taking

place in New York City May 16-18.</p>

<p>The bad news is that we are not holding an Autodesk AEC DevCamp this year, as we did on a bi-annual basis on the North American West Coast in

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/devcamp-session-on-whats-new.html">2008</a>,

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/api-training-and-aec-devcamp-material.html">2010</a> and

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/06/aec-devcamp-2012-material.html">2012</a>,

and out of sequence in

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/key-concepts-of-the-family-editor.html">
Moscow, Russia, last year</a>.</p>

<p>However, the

<a href="http://core.thorntontomasetti.com/aec-technology-symposium-2014">
AEC Technology Symposium</a> offers

another and even better opportunity to get up close and personal with Autodesk AEC software engineers.</p>

<p>The symposium itself is held on Friday the 16th, followed by a

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">
Hackathon</a> over the weekend.</p>

<p>This is a very exciting venue for anyone interested in cutting edge AEC technology, BIM 360, Dynamo, Revit, and non-Autodesk AEC technologies too.</p>

<p>As said, this is a great and actually unique opportunity &ndash; at least in this year &ndash; for you to interact directly with Autodesk software engineers during the Hackathon &ndash; helping you learn new technologies and solve your pressing development challenges &ndash; and, just as importantly, during the talks on the first day, learn about cutting edge AEC technology from industry thought leaders (not just Autodesk).</p>

<p>We hope to meet many of you that attended the AEC DevCamp in the past at this year’s

<p>Our apologies for the late notice, especially to all of you folks not based in North America.</p>
