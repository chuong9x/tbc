<h3>Changing a Family Parameter from Type to Instance</h3>

<p>Here is a short and simple question that just cropped up and required some digging around until my colleague Phil Xia came up with the right answer:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it possible to change the type of a family parameter programmatically?

<p>This is possible in the family editor.

<p>I only see the IsInstance property, though, and it is read-only.

<p>I could achieve the same effect by deleting the parameter and creating a new one.
Obviously that would require updating all the existing values, though, if there are any, to change from the old parameter to the new one.
I don't really see this as an option.
Besides, the parameter could be referenced from other parameters.

<p>Seeing that this is possible from within the family editor, I actually donâ€™t see any need for this property to be read-only.

<p>I don't think changing a family parameter from type to instance and vice versa should not be so hard.

<p>Is there some other method that allows me to achieve this?


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, sure, you are lucky, and so are we all: the following two FamilyManager methods set the given family parameter to instance or type:

<ul>
<li>MakeInstance &ndash; Set the family parameter as an instance parameter.
<li>MakeType &ndash; Set the family parameter as a type parameter.
</ul>

<p>I hope this will save you from repeating the same digging all over again  :-)</p>

<p>Many thanks to Phil for explicitly pointing this out!</p>
