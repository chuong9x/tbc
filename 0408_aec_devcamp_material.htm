<h3>API Training and AEC DevCamp Material</h3>

<p>I am back again from a wonderful holiday in Greece!
I spent one week in a retreat centre in the village of Kissos, and then a couple of days on the Banika beach north of Agios Ioannis and south of Chorefton. 
I was there with a friend, we had a little cooking stove and food for a couple of days, slept on our mats in the sand in a little cave, went swimming and played with the stones on the beach.
One nice novel experience was building a little raft with a couple of empty bottles, sticks and string to carry a five litre canister and swim with it to the neighbouring beach to get some water to live on.

<h4>Revit API Training</h4>

<p>Anyway, now I am back and getting up to speed again with current issues surrounding the Revit API.
This summer, my colleagues and I are holding a number of Revit API trainings around the world.
