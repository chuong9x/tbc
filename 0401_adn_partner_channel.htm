<h3>YouTube ADN Partner Channel</h3>

<p>As Kean Walmsley pointed out, a new 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2010/06/adn-partner-channel-on-youtube.html">
YouTube ADN Partner Channel</a> has

been created to showcase solutions created by ADN partners.

<p>ADN Members can upload videos to it, and Autodesk customers can view it to get an impression of the breadth of available add-on products.

<p>ADN is an acronym for the

Autodesk Developer Network</a>,

whose members make use of Autodesk products and their application programming interfaces (APIs) and receive support from the DevTech team that I work in.
