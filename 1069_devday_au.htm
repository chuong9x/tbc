</ul>

<p>Us Revit add-in developers are obviously most interested in the first of these.</p>


<a name="6"></a>

<h4>BIM &ndash; Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Infrastructure Breakout Session</h4>

<p>The BIM and AEC session focused on three main topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The future of Revit and its APIs &ndash;
pushing the frontiers of BIM beyond building design and creating opportunities for increasingly complex models ready for detailing and fabrication.</li>
<li>BIM for infrastructure platforms and new web services APIs &ndash;
create and use intelligent 3D models to plan, design, build, and manage infrastructure.
InfraWorks combines 3D modelling and visualisation technologies for desktop, web, and mobile to allow collaboration on infrastructure models in new, exciting and productive ways. Use the new InfraWorks APIs to integrate with your applications and enable fast and easy infrastructure data exchange and interoperability
in InfraWorks, Civil 3D, Revit and other Autodesk products.</li>
<li>BIM 360 Platforms and new web service APIs &ndash;
BIM in the cloud provides access to common, up-to-date model information anywhere, any time.
APIs available now for Autodesk BIM 360 Glue and Autodesk BIM 360 Field, including the new display component API, deep data-sharing between our BIM technologies, roadmap for the future of BIM in the cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disconnect from Central Before Removing Updater Reference</h4>

<p>If you subscribe to a dynamic model updater in a BIM and later open the model in an environment lacking the add-in implementing the updater, Revit may display a warning message that may be confusing or disconcerting to the uninitiated.</p>

<p>I explained how to

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/vsta-to-stay-and-updater-to-go.html#2">
remove an updater reference</a> way

back in the Revit 2011 timeframe, including

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/vsta-to-stay-and-updater-to-go.html#3">automating the removal process</a>.</p>

<p>The process described there could be executed in batch mode over all your models, or at least over the ones that you wish to send to customers.</p>

<p>In newer versions of Revit, the updater itself can specify programmatically that no warning should appear if the updater is not found, as explained in the list of

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/02/whats-new-in-the-revit-2012-api.html">what's new in the Revit 2012 API</a>:</p>

<h5 style="color:darkblue">Dynamic Update Framework API changes</h5>

<p style="color:darkblue">There are new settings to flag an updater as optional. Optional updaters will not cause prompting the end user when they are opening a document that was modified by that updater but the updater is not currently registered. Optional updaters should be used only when necessary. By default, updaters are non-optional. New methods introduced to support this change are:</p>

<ul style="color:darkblue">
<li>UpdaterRegistry.SetIsUpdaterOptional(UpdaterId id, bool isOptional)</li>
<li>UpdaterRegistry.RegisterUpdater(UpdaterId id, bool isOptional)</li>
<li>UpdaterRegistry.RegisterUpdater(UpdaterId id, Document doc, bool isOptional)</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:darkblue">New methods were added to access information about currently registered updaters:</p>

<ul style="color:darkblue">
<li>UpdaterRegistry.GetRegisteredUpdaterInfos(Document doc)</li>
<li>UpdaterRegistry.GetRegisteredUpdaterInfos()</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:darkblue">Revit now disallows any calls to UpdaterRegistry from within the Execute() method of an updater. That means any calls to RegistryUpdater(), AddTrigger(), etc. will now throw an exception. The only method of UpdaterRegistry allowed to be called during execution of an updater is UnregisterUpdater(,) but the updater to be unregistered must be not the one currently being executed.</p>

<p>That will not help you with old or existing models, though.</p>

<p>I tested the very simple and logical steps to

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/vsta-to-stay-and-updater-to-go.html#2">
remove an updater reference</a> on

your sample model and they worked absolutely fine for me:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the model in the user interface.</li>
<li>Select 'continue working and do not warn me again'.</li>
<li>Save and close the file.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I reopen the file the next time, the warning is gone.</p>

<p>By the way, you always should disconnect your files from central before sending them to us for testing.</p>

<p>I see the following messages when opening your file:</p>

<ul>
<li>1_central_model_msg.png</li>
<li>2_missing_updater.png</li>
<li>3_cannot_find_central.png</li>
<li>4_save_not_synced.png</li>
</ul>

<p>After performing the removal described above, the updater warning disappears.
On reopening again, I only see the 'cannot find central' message.</p>

<p>The developer responded:
"I tried it again and it didn’t work.
Then I remembered your comment about detaching from central (sorry about that), did that and tried again.
Then it worked."</p>

<p>Motto: disconnect from central to remove an updater.</p>

<h4>Autodesk Chronicle Launch</h4>

<p><a href="https://chronicle.autodesk.com">
Chronicle</a> is

a free technology preview that enables capturing, sharing, and learning from software workflows, currently supporting AutoCAD, Revit, and Inventor.</p>

<p>It is being launched now at AU.</p>

<p>Chronicle consists of a recording utility to capture recordings, and a web site that displays the recordings as Chronicles, interactive video tutorials. The videos can be shared publically or set to private, so that they can be used as internal training materials for a private office or classroom. In essence, Chronicle allows software experts to showcase their expertise and allows other users to view and learn from their real-world expert examples.</p>

<p>The Chronicle Recording Utility captures workflows from within Autodesk products. It records a continuous video screen capture and optionally voice narration. It is also records the timing and details of workflow information, such as the commands, tools, settings, and dialog boxes used during the workflow. Captured data is uploaded to the Chronicle website. An author can publish the Chronicle as public or private, so the desired user group can view a video of the workflow. Additionally, the captured workflow events are displayed on an interactive timeline, enhancing the viewing and learning experience.</p>

<h4>View Depth Override Macro and Chronicle Sample</h4>

<p>Just by chance, I happened to notice the

<a href="http://puntorevit.blogspot.it/2013/10/view-depth-override-2014-codice-sorgente.html">
View Depth Override macro</a>

(<a href="zip/ViewDepthOverride2014.cs">source</a>)

on the

<a href="http://puntorevit.blogspot.it">Punto Revit</a> blog by

Paolo Emilio Serra and his more recent

running

a macro in perspective mode, currently still work in progress, and thought that might be of interest to others as well.
Looks like interesting stuff.</p>

<p>By the way, the demos on those pages are recorded using the preview version of Chronicle, so you can see some nice live examples of that functionality in use.</p>

<h4>Sound of Noise</h4>

<p>My son Christopher has been actively creating and publishing music on SoundCloud as

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/allerdings">Allerdings</a>.</p>

<p>One nice little sample is

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/allerdings/hydrophonie">Hydrophonie</a>,

created from nothing but natural sounds recorded using a glass of water and some sesame seeds:</p>

<center>
<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/112570612&amp;color=ff6600&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_artwork=true"></iframe>
</center>

<p>Christopher now set up his own Internet presence at

<a href="http://soundofnoise.de">SoundOfNoise</a>.</p>

<p>Exciting stuff, and congratulations!</p>
