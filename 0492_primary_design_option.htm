<h3>Primary Design Option</h3>

<p>Here is a neat little

idea by Benson</a> on 

how to retrieve the primary design option in a project that has been rattling around in my to-do list for a while now and seems suitable for a Tel Aviv Saturday morning post:

<p>The method DesignOption.GetActiveDesignOptionId exists in the Revit 2011 API, and this method can return the 'active' design option id.
However, it is not the primary design option id.

<p>The DesignOption class property IsPrimary indicates whether a design option is primary.

<p>So, we can iterate though all design options and use that property to determine the primary one.

<p>The Revit 2010 API does not provides the method 'GetActiveDesignOptionId' and property 'IsPrimary', so it seems impossible to get the active design option and primary option in that version.

<p>Thanks to Benson for this hint!
