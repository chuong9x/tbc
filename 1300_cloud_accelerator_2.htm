announcement of the first Autodesk Cloud Accelerator</a> two

months ago.</p>

<p>Apply soon &ndash; the deadline is looming on the horizon, on April 19, 2015.</p>

<p>Here are some of the preliminary results and feedback from the first accelerator:</p>

<p>12 proposals were selected from 50 applications, targeted at the following domains:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com">View & Data</a></li>
<li>3 <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/bim-360">BIM 360</a></li>
<li>3 <a href="http://autocad.io/Home/Overview">AutoCAD I/O</a></li>
<li>2 <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/recap/features/photo-recap-360/all/gallery-view">ReCap Photo</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All the attendees were very happy with the event and made significant progress integrating our APIs into their applications.</p>

<p>The new products are well underway to being launched!</p>

<p>The accelerator web site provides a list of the attending companies.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits the attendees mentioned were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access to Autodesk engineering teams &ndash; the people who wrote the APIs &ndash; to get one-on-one advice and assistance with their work.</li>
<li>Access to senior Autodesk staff, including Amar Hanspal and Scott Reese.</li>
<li>Access to the Autodesk product management teams to talk in person about their own needs for future API enhancements &ndash; every API team ran at least one feedback session.</li>
<li>An environment sitting together with fellow developers working on similar ideas &ndash; several participants changed direction during the event as a result of sharing ideas with their neighbours.</li>
<li>Discovering and learning about new APIs from peers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The website has already been updated with some of the feedback, with lots more to follow soon.</p>

<p>Good luck preparing your application!</p>
