<h3>Meetings, Football, and RevitRubyShell</h3>

<p>The whole EMEA DevTech team is meeting in Neuch&acirc;tel prior to the coming weekend's

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2012/07/thinking-about-au-2012-and-vacation.html">
annual Autodesk football tournament</a> taking place here.

I won't be able to play myself, unfortunately, for the first time in many years, since I had a prior appointment with friends to climb the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzhorn">Spitzhorn</a> mountain this very weekend.

<p>We also held a virtual meeting with Stephen Preston from the US, who is now our world-wide DevTech manager.
Here we are in virtual union, from left to right, Gary Wassell, Marat Mirgaleev, Vladimir Ananyev, Stephen (virtually), Jeremy, Adam Nagy and Philippe Leefsma:</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I finally got around to taking a quick look at a completely new exciting topic:

<a name="2"></a>

<h4>RevitRubyShell</h4>

<p>I 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/revit-python-shell.html">
repeatedly</a>

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/03/dynamically-load-and-debug-plugins.html">
pointed out</a>

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/09/access-to-curtain-grid-panels.html">
the power</a> of 

being able to interact directly with the Revit API using Daren Thomas' 

<a href="http://code.google.com/p/revitpythonshell">Revit Python shell</a>,

originally implemented for Revit 2010, then for 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/python-shell-in-revit-and-vasari.html">
Vasari</a>,

and updated for

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/python-shell-for-revit-2012-and-vasari-21.html">
Revit 2012 and Vasari 2.1</a> last autumn.

<p>Here is another interactive interactive Revit programming environment by 

<a href="http://www.hclausen.net">H&aring;kon Clausen</a> of 

<a href="http://www.nosyko.no">
Nosyko AS</a>.

<p>His RevitRubyShell is based on the interpreted language 

<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby programming language</a>, 

which is more modern than 

<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> and

inherently object oriented.

<p>According to the introductory blurb on its home page, Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. 
It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

<p>Kean Walmsley also had a look at it in its IronRuby incarnation for use in 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/ruby">
programming AutoCAD</a>.

He presents a first overview and introduction to Ruby in his initial post on 

<a href="http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2009/04/using-ironruby-inside-autocad.html">
using IronRuby with AutoCAD</a>.

<p>Here is the 

<a href="https://github.com/hakonhc/RevitRubyShell">
Ruby Shell source code</a>.

<!--

<a href="http://www.hclausen.net/RevitRubyShell/RevitRubyShellInstaller.application">
an installer</a> which

should be opened IE and will install the add-in directly.

-->

<p>Håkon says: I hope you will find this useful. 
I use it a lot for rapid prototyping and testing when programming against the Revit API.

<!--

<p>I discussed the interactive Revit programming possibility offered by Daren Thomas' 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/revit-python-shell.html">
Revit Python shell</a> a

couple of times, originally for Revit 2010, then for 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/07/python-shell-in-revit-and-vasari.html">
Vasari</a>,

and for

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/python-shell-for-revit-2012-and-vasari-21.html">
Revit 2012 and Vasari 2.1</a>.

It has been updated again since then, obviously, and is used a lot by the Vasari guys.


<p>Now there is another interactive Revit programming environment available as well:

<p><a href="http://www.hclausen.net">H&aring;kon Clausen</a> implemented and released an interactive Revit programming console

<a href="https://github.com/hakonhc/RevitRubyShell">
RevitRubyShell</a> based 

-->

<p>It sports the simplest installation I have ever seen for any Revit add-in whatsoever, the absolutely ultimate one-click

<a href="http://www.hclausen.net/RevitRubyShell/setup.exe">
RevitRubyShell installer</a>,

which should be opened IE and will install the add-in directly, setting up an external application creating its own simple single-button panel:</p>

<center>
<img src="img/ruby_panel.png" alt="RevitRubyShell add-in panel"/>
</center>

<p>Clicking the button launches the Revit Ruby shell including a snippet of sample code that can be immediately executed by pressing the blue 'Run' arrow button:</p>

</center>

<p>Well worth looking at, and might prove a huge programming productivity booster.

<p>Many thanks to H&aring;kon for developing and sharing this!
