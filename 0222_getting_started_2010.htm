<p>I am back again from a great vacation in Italy which I mostly spent outdoors camping, swimming, cooking, and drinking cappuchino.
Yesterday was the 

<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je%C3%BBne_f%C3%A9d%C3%A9ral">
Je&ucirc;ne F&eacute;d&eacute;ral holiday</a> (French)

in Neuch&acirc;tel.
I used that to make a first pass through my overfull email inbox.

<p>Meanwhile, here is a quick summary and overview of the material we have put together so far for getting started with the Revit 2010 API.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you have any updated information similar to the getting started material for Revit 2009?
I would like to hear about the news and differences between the Revit 2010 and 2009 APIs.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> First of all, for completeness sake, here is the back pointer to the final wrap-up overview of the getting started material for the Revit 2009 API:
