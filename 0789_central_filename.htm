<h3>Worksharing Central Filename</h3>

<p>Here is a simple question that several people stumbled over and apparently can use some clarification:


<p><strong>Question:</strong> In Revit 2012, I used the Document WorksharingCentralFilename property to get the location of the central file.

<p>This is marked as deprecated in Revit 2013, and the API suggests using GetWorksharingCentralModelPath instead.

<p>In my experiments with a central file, I can use this function to obtain a ModelPath object which provides a property named CentralServerPath, but it is blank.

<p>How can I recreate the functionality of the deprecated WorksharingCentralFilename property?


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> CentralServerPath is the wrong thing to call to get the path to the central model.
It is the path to Revit Server itself.

<p>You obviously need to be clear about whether you are using Revit Server or file-based centrals.
The central server path for a file-based central is obviously blank.

<p>The ModelPath class belongs to the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/03/many-issues-resolved.html">
linked model related functionality</a> provided

in the Revit 2012 API, which also includes the ModelPathUtils class.

<p>A ModelPath stores a path to a location on disk, a network drive, or a Revit Server location.

<p>ModelPathUtils provides methods for converting between ModelPath and String.

<p>When working with ModelPath objects, you can use the Compare method to test for equality or for ordering, the predicates IsServerPath and IsFilePath to test whether the path is file-based or server-based, and the ModelPathUtils ConvertModelPathToUserVisiblePath method to convert a ModelPath to a string.

<p>The latter is demonstrated in the discussion of

listing linked files and the TransmissionData class</a>.
