<h3>Revit 2011 DevTV</h3>

<p>The Revit DevTV recordings are probably the absolutely most efficient learning resource for quickly getting a hands-on experience of programming Revit. They include

<ul>
<li>Overview of the SDK
<li>Installation of samples 
<li>Creating your first add-in
<li>Iterating over database elements
<li>Selecting an element
<li>Extracting element parameter data
<li>... And much more!
</ul>

<p>The first version was created for 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/getting-started.html">
Revit 2008</a>, 

and that was reused for the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/08/getting-started.html">
Revit 2009 training material</a> as well.

Augusto Gon&ccedil;alves of Autodesk Brazil created an updated version for 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/12/updated-devtv-introduction-to-revit-programming.html">
Revit 2010</a> in 

December 2009, and he also created the wonderful 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/devtv-addin-templates.html">
DevTV add-in templates for Revit 2011</a>.

<p>Now we have a vastly improved version for the Revit 2011 API.
It is split into two parts to make it more manageable.
Part 1 was again created by Augusto, in English and Portuguese, and Part 2 by Adam Nagy.
They are hosted on the 

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">Revit Developer Center</a> site 

and also accessible through the following links which I copied from there:

<ul>

<p>Here are the detailed tables of contents:

<h5>Part 1</h5>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<li>Hello World
<li>Add-In Manager
<li>External Command
<li>Selection
<li>Revit Lookup
<li>Database
<li>Filters
<li>Parameters
<li>Learning More
</ol>

<h5>Part 2</h5>

<ol>
<li>Introduction
<li>Add-In in Action
<li>Add-In Framework
<li>Picking Objects
<li>RevitLookup Tool
<li>Element Filtering
<li>Testing the Add-In
<li>Add-In Manager
<li>Learning More
</ol>

<h5>Part 2 Expands on Part 1</h5>

<p>There is a certain apparent overlap between the two tables of content, because the two presentations cover related materials using different examples and highlighting different important aspects.
Part 2 is a significant expansion over Part 1, however. As Adam puts it, the difference is that Part 2 discusses how to use what you learned in Part 1:

<ol>
<li>Introduction &ndash; Part of the DevTV framework.
<li>Add-In in Action &ndash; explains what the add-in will do.
<li>Add-In Framework &ndash; refers back to Part 1 without going into details.
<li>Picking Objects &ndash; Part 1 talks about iterating the currently selected objects, Part 2 talks about picking.
<li>RevitLookup Tool &ndash; Part 1 has a quick look at it but does not 'use' it, whereas Part 2 does.
<li>Element Filtering &ndash; Part 1 presented the OfClass and OfCategory shortcuts; Part 2 goes further by showing WherePasses and ParameterFilter.
<li>Testing the Add-In &ndash; just a very quick test this time.
<li>Add-In Manager &ndash; Part 2 actually shows how to use it, while Part 1 just mentioned it.
<li>Learning More &ndash; Part of the DevTV framework.
</ol>

<h5>DevTV Template Update</h5>

<p>By the way, it is extremely easy to edit the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/07/devtv-addin-templates.html">
DevTV Visual Studio Wizard templates</a> included with Part 1.

Simply unzip the files to the hard disk, edit them just as you see fit, and zip them back up again.

For example, here is 

<a href="zip/TemplateRevitArchAddinCsJt.zip">
my personalised C# DevTV template</a> which 

generates an absolutely minimal C# Revit add-in skeleton with all comments removed and some additional copyright information added to the assembly properties.
